[13/06/17, 12:07:56 PM] Papa: May be happiness and peace is more of a Chemistry phenomenon. The key molecules are Serotonin, Oxytocin, Endophins and Dopamine. Probably in next 50 years time, there would be overdose of happiness. The Buddhist thinking is only the nearest in non-Chemistry way to allow logical reasoning and understanding yourself internally and try to deal issues like immortality, happiness or divinity. But many after even decades of belief have started to think may be there is no meaning in the meaning. But worth going through it for the knowledge and experience.
[13/06/17, 1:07:23 PM] Chordi Pune: 🤔🤔🤔😧
[13/06/17, 6:45:25 PM] Papa: By the way leading psychologists have concluded that there are better ways to BUY happiness. The Baby Boomers like us probably thought money can buy it. The Millennials think Experiences can bring happiness. Even a bad experience is considered as more memorable and providing an experienced perspective.
[13/06/17, 9:04:32 PM] Chordi Pune: This story is about famous Queen Victoria.

This is a very rare but very effective human trait which only true leaders can demonstrate.

Queen Victoria was once at a diplomatic reception in London. The guest of honour was an African Chieftain. All went well during the meal until, at the end, finger bowls were served.

The guest of honour had never seen a British finger bowl and no one had thought of briefing him beforehand about its purpose. So, he took the bowl in his hands, lifted it to his mouth and drank its contents down.

For an instant, there was breathless silence among the British privileged guests and then they began to whisper to one another.

However , they stopped when Queen Victoria silently took her finger bowl in her hands, lifted it and drank its contents. A moment later, 500 surprised British Ladies and Gentlemen simultaneously drank the contents of their own finger bowls.

It was the queen’s uncommon courtesy that guarded her guest from a great embarrassment.

*MORAL*: While the most common human trait is to look for chances to humiliate someone else or to be neutral when they make a mistake, it takes presence of mind and an uncommon courtesy to follow someone else’s mistake in order to guard them from embarrassment.

As it is said, "To make people cry is easy; to make them laugh is difficult; to make them think mindfully is impossible". Afterall, *PRESENCE OF MIND IS THE REWARD OF TOLERANCE AND THE ESSENCE OF TRUE LEADERSHIP*

And this is the message;

*"Collapsing any nation does not require use of atomic bombs or the use of long range missiles. It only requires lowering the quality of education and allowing cheating in the examinations by the students".*

The patient dies in the hands of such doctors

And the buildings collapse in the hands of such engineers

And the money is lost in the hands of such accountants

And humanity dies in the hands of such religious scholars

And justice is lost in the hands of such judges...

*"The collapse of education is the collapse of the nation"*

[25/06/17, 12:31:55 PM] Chordi Pune: ********খিচুড়ি******

  কই গো শুনছো?
বলো কি বলবে?আশি বছরের অবিনাশ বাবু বললেন—— এমন বাদলা দিনে একটু গরম খিচুড়ি খেতে ইচ্ছে করছে গিন্নী।  
——মুগ মুসুরীর ডাল বাড়ন্ত। ———এই তো কদিন আগে কিনে আনলাম এর মধ্যে ফুরিয়ে গেল?
——তবে কি আমি চিবিয়ে খেয়েছি?আনাটাও একমাস হতে চলল। কলাই ডালের খিচুড়ি খাবে?
———আমাকে কি গোরু পেয়েছো?—
—আহা গোরু তো দুধ দেয়। 
—~মানে তার চেয়েও নিকৃষ্ট আমি?
——বলেছি একবারও। 

সাধে কি আর মা বলেছিল——কি বলেছিল গো?——খোকা বিয়ের আগে ভালো মন্দ আমার হাতে খেয়ে নে। ——তাই নাকি ধেড়ে খোকা?——বিয়ের পরে বৌ ছাই পাঁশ খাওয়াবে।
বুড়ো বয়স পর্যন্ত ছাই পাঁশ গিলে এসেছো বুঝি? ঘাটের দিকে পা বাড়িয়ে তো দুজনেই বসে আছি। কোনকালে ঘি খেয়েছিলে তার গন্ধ এখনও লেগে আছে?আমার মাও তো বলেছিলো———ঐ গুঁফো ছেলেটাকে দেখতে গুন্ডার মতো ওর সংগে আমার খুকুর বিয়ে কিছুতেই দেবনা। দুর্ভাগ্য আমার গোঁফ দেখেই প্রেমে পড়েছিলাম। 
———মানেটা কি?সারাজীবন তোমার সংগে গুন্ডাগিরি করেছি? সুখে রাখতে পারিনি?
———বলেছি একবারও। যখনই সুখি হব হব মনে করেছি তখনই তো খুঁত ধরে মাতৃবন্দনা শুরু করতে। আজও রেহাই নেই। 
———ঘাট হয়েছে বাবা খিচুড়ি খেতে চেয়ে। এমন কথা শুনতে হবে জানলে কোন শালা খিচুড়ি খেতে চাইতো। আজ কচু সেদ্ধ ভাতই করে দিও

খেতে বসে অবিনাশ বাবু চমকে গেলেন। গরম ধোঁয়া ওঠা সুগন্ধী আতপ চাল আর মুগডাল দিয়ে খিচুড়ি,আলু ভাজা,বোঁটা শুদ্ধ প্রিয় বেগুন ভাজা আর ডিমের ওমলেট সংগে ঘরে তৈরী আমের আচার। একমুখ হেসে খেতে বসে বললেন———তবে সকাল থেকে এত ঝগড়া করলে কেন?
——মধুরেন সমাপয়েত। ঝগড়া করি বলেই তো মনে হয় বেঁচে আছি। জীবন বড় সুন্দর গো। (clctd)

Somebody said you learn how to be a mother by instinct... 
That somebody, never took a three-year-old shopping.
  
Somebody said you can't love the second child as much as you love the first... That somebody doesn't have two children. 

Somebody said the hardest part of being a mother is labour and delivery... That somebody never watched her 'baby' get on the bus for the first day of  kindergarten or on a plane headed for 'hostel education.' 
 
Somebody said a mother can stop worrying after her child gets married...
That somebody doesn't know that marriage adds a new son or daughter-in-law to a 
mother's heartstrings. 

Somebody said a mother's job is done when her last child leaves home...
That somebody never had grandchildren. 

Somebody said your mother knows you love her, so you don't need to tell her...

[08/07/17, 11:08:28 AM] Moon Pishi: Mr.Sunil D.Patil .Pune (Ex.Director Symbiosis.) Forwarded this post in a group which I am forwarding for your knowledge.......... KILLER IN YOUR FRIDGE

SWEET POISON..A MUST READ !!!

In October of 2001, my sister started getting very sick She had stomach spasms and she was having a hard time getting around. Walking was a major chore. It took everything she had just to get out of bed; she was in so much pain.

By March 2002, she had undergone several tissue and muscle biopsies and was on 24 various prescription medications. The doctors could not determine what was wrong with her. She was in so much pain, and so sick she just knew she was dying.

She put her house, bank accounts, life insurance, etc., in her oldest daughter's name, and made sure that her younger children were to be taken care of.

She also wanted her last hooray, so she planned a trip to Florida (basically in a wheelchair) for March 22nd.

On March 19, I called her to ask how her most recent tests went, and she said they didn't find anything on the test, but they believe she had MS.

I recalled an article a friend of mine e-mailed to me and I asked my sister if she drank diet soda? She told me that she did. As a matter of fact, she was getting ready to crack one open that moment.

I told her not to open it, and to stop drinking the diet soda! I e-mailed her an article my friend, a lawyer, had sent. My sister called me within 32 hours after our phone conversation and told me she had stopped drinking the diet soda AND she could walk! The muscle spasms went away. She said she didn't feel 100% but, she sure felt a lot better.

She told me she was going to her doctor with this article and would call me when she got home.

Well, she called me, and said her doctor was amazed! He is going to call all of his MS patients to find out if they consumed artificial sweeteners of any kind. In a nutshell, she was being poisoned by the Aspartame in the diet soda.. and literally dying a slow and miserable death

When she got to Florida March 22, all she had to take was one pill, and that was a pill for the Aspartame poisoning! She is well on her way to a complete recovery. And she is walking! No wheelchair! This article saved her life.If it says 'SUGAR FREE' on the label; DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!I have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on 'ASPARTAME,' marketed as'Nutra Sweet,' 'Equal,' and 'Spoonful.'In the keynote address by the EPA, it was announced that in the United States in 2001 there is an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus. It was difficult to determine exactly what toxin was causing this to be rampant. I stood up and said that I was there to lecture on exactly that subject.

I will explain why Aspartame is so dangerous: When the temperature of this sweetener exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol in ASPARTAME converts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants. The methanol toxicity mimics, among other conditions, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus.

Many people were being diagnosed in error. Although multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence, Methanol toxicity is!

Systemic lupus has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis, especially with Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers.The victim usually does not know that the Aspartame is the culprit. He or she continues its use; irritating the lupus to such a degree that it may become a life-threatening condition. We have seen patients with systemic lupus become asymptotic, once taken off diet sodas.

In cases of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, most of the symptoms disappear. We've seen many cases where vision loss returned and hearing loss improved markedly.

This also applies to cases of tinnitus and fibromyalgia. During a lecture, I said, 'If you are using ASPARTAME (Nutra Sweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting, pains, numbness in your legs,
Cramps,
Vertigo,
Dizziness,
Headaches,
Tinnitus,
Joint pain,
Unexplainable depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss you probably have ASPARTAME poisoning!' People were jumping up during the lecture saying,'I have some of these symptoms. Is it reversible?'

Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
STOP drinking diet sodas and be alert for Aspartame on food labels! Many products are fortified with it! This is a serious problem. Dr. Espart (one of my speakers) remarked that so many people seem to be symptomatic for MS and during his recent visit to a hospice; a nurse stated that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence!

Diet soda is NOT a diet product! It is a chemically altered, multiple SODIUM (salt) and ASPARTAME containing product that actually makes you crave carbohydrates.

It is far more likely to make you GAIN weight!

These products also contain formaldehyde, which stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs. Formaldehyde is an absolute toxin and is used primarily to preserve 'tissue specimens.'

Many products we use every day contain this chemical but we SHOULD NOT store it IN our body!

Dr. H. J. Roberts stated in his lectures that once free of the 'diet products' and with no significant increase in exercise; his patients lost an average of 19 pounds over a trial period.Aspartame is especially dangerous for diabetics. We found that some physicians, who believed that they had a patient with retinopathy, in fact, had symptoms caused by Aspartame. The Aspartame drives the blood sugar out of control. Thus diabetics may suffer acute memory loss due to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are NEUROTOXIC when taken without the other amino acids necessary for a good balance.

Treating diabetes is all about BALANCE.. Especially with diabetics, the Aspartame passes the blood/brain barrier and it then deteriorates the neurons of the brain; causing various levels of brain damage, Seizures, Depression, Manic depression, Panic attacks, Uncontrollable anger and rage.Consumption of Aspartame causes these same symptoms in non-diabetics as well. Documentation and observation also reveal that thousands of children diagnosed with ADD and ADHD have had complete turnarounds in their behavior when these chemicals have been removed from their diet.

So called 'behavior modification prescription drugs' (Ritalin and others) are no longer needed.Truth be told, they were never NEEDED in the first place!Most of these children were being 'poisoned' on a daily basis with the very foods that were 'better for them than sugar.'It is also suspected that the Aspartame in thousands of pallets of diet Coke and diet Pepsi consumed by men and women fighting in the Gulf War, may be partially to blame for the well-known Gulf War Syndrome.

Dr. Roberts warns that it can cause birth defects, i.e. mental retardation, if taken at the time of conception and during early pregnancy. Children are especially at risk for neurological disorders and should NEVER be given artificial sweeteners.

There are many different case histories to relate of children suffering grand mal seizures and other neurological disturbances talking about a plague of neurological diseases directly caused by the use of this deadly poison.'

Herein lies the problem: There were Congressional Hearings when Aspartame was included in 100 different products and strong objection was made concerning its use. Since this initial hearing, there have been two subsequent hearings, and still nothing has been done. The drug and chemical lobbies have very deep pockets.

Sadly, MONSANTO'S patent on Aspartame has EXPIRED! There are now over 5,000 products on the market that contain this deadly chemical and there will be thousands more introduced. Everybody wants a 'piece of the Aspartame pie.'I assure you that MONSANTO, the creator of Aspartame, knows how deadly it is.

And isn't it ironic that MONSANTO funds, among others, the American Diabetes Association, the American Dietetic Association and the Conference of the American College of Physicians?

This has been recently exposed in the New York Times. These [organizations] cannot criticize any additives or convey their link to MONSANTO because they take money from the food industry and are required to endorse their products.Senator Howard Metzenbaum wrote and presented a bill that would require label warnings on products containing Aspartame, especially regarding pregnant women, children and infants.

The bill would also institute independent studies on the known dangers and the problems existing in the general population regarding seizures, changes in brain chemistry, neurological changes and behavioural symptoms.
The bill was killed.It is known that the powerful drug and chemical lobbies are responsible for this, letting loose the hounds of disease and death on an unsuspecting and  uninformed public. Well, you're informed now!

Please pass this on to ur family and friends!
[08/07/17, 11:52:45 AM] Papa: Thanks. The aspartame side effects have been checked by FDA for last 30 years probably. So it is an approved product. But can surely may not work on a certain person. Still worth being cautious.

[12/07/17, 10:04:46 PM] Chordi Pune: Salute Our Mythology: 

            "Mom, I am a genetic scientist. I am working in the US on the evolution of man. Theory of evolution. Charles Darwin, have you heard of him? " Vasu asked.

          His Mother sat next to him,  smiled and said, "I know about Darwin, Vasu. But Have you heard of Dashavatar? The ten avatars of Vishnu?" 

Vasu replied 'no'.

          "Ok! Then let me tell you what 
you and your Darwin don't know.

         Listen carefully- 

         The first avatar was the Matsya avatar, it means the fish. That is because life began in the water. Is that not right?" 

           Vasu began to listen with a little more attention.

             She continued, "Then came the Kurma Avatar, which means the tortoise, because life moved from the water to the land. The amphibian! So the Tortoise denoted the evolution from sea to land.

            Third avatar was Varaha, the wild boar, which meant the wild animals with not much intellect, you call them the Dinosaurs, correct?" Vasu nodded wide eyed.

            "The fourth avatar was Narasimha, half man and half animal, the evolution from wild animals to intelligent beings.

             Fifth, the Waman avatar, the midget or dwarf, who could grow really tall. Do you know why that is? Because, there were two kinds of humans, Homo Erectus and Homo Sapiens and Homo Sapiens won that battle." 

            Vasu could see that his Mother was in full flow and he was stupefied.

          "The Sixth avatar was Parshuram, the man who wielded the axe, the man who was a cave and forest dweller. Angry, and not social.

           The seventh avatar was Ram, the first rational thinking social being, who practised and laid out the laws of society and the basis of human relationships.

           The Eighth avatar was Balarama, a true farmer who showed  value of agriculture in the life.

          The Ninth avatar was Krishna, the statesman, the politician, the diplomat, the Ambassador, the sutile interpreter, the lover who played the game of society and taught how to live and thrive in the adhaarmic social structure.

           And finally, my boy, will come Kalki, the man you are working on. The man who will be genetically supreme."

            Vasu looked at his Mother speechless. "This is amazing Mom, how did you .... ? This makes sense!"

           She said, "Yes it does Vasu! We Indians knew some amazing things, but just didn't know how to pass it on scientifically. So we made them into mythological stories.  Mythology creates faith and makes man sensible. It is just the way you look at it - Religious or Scientific. Your call."
           Vasu touched the feet of his mother and hugged her. She kissed him smilingly.

[13/07/17, 11:17:05 AM] Chordi Pune: Very important for you!! 
Explain this to your kids ! 

*Energy Flows where Attention Goes.*
*Everything in our Universe is Energy.* 

We human beings are also Energy. 
So it is very important to learn how Energy flows from from us & how it effects our lives.

When you say, 
“ I don’t want War.” You are giving your attention to War and where you give your attention, your Energy will flow there. 

Law of Attraction will match your Energy with that and bring it in your Three Dimension reality.

So instead of saying, “ I don’t want War.” you should say 
“I want Peace.” 
Then your attention is on Peace, so you are giving your Energy to Peace and Law of Attraction will match your Energy with Peace and your life will be Peaceful. 

This Universe works on Vibrations.

So similarly change your statements –

– Instead of saying 
“ I don’t want to fail.” say 
“I want to Win”
– Instead of saying
“I don’t want to be fat.” say 
“I want to be slim”
– Instead of saying
“I don’t want to have a struggling job” say
“I want to have a happy and exciting job”
– Instead of saying
“I don’t want to fight with my husband” say 
“I want to have a happy relationship with my husband”
and so on..

Our thoughts are very powerful because Energy is transmitted through our thoughts.

If you think and speak about what you don’t want, you will attract what you don’t want! 
But if you stop talking and thinking about what you don’t want and change your vocabulary and only think and talk about what you want, then you will start attracting what you want, and what you don’t want will gradually vanish from your life. 

I believe from today you will stop thinking and talking about things that you don’t want. 

I will suggest you to remove few words from your dictionary like –

Depression/ Hatred/ Failure/ Illness/Disease/ War/ Fights/ Anxiety/ Struggle/ Debt/ Enemies/ Terrible/ Accidents

Changing your thought patterns will help you channelize your Energy & your Life will Change accordingly. 

This will then create a Future with Abundance of Happiness, Joy, Peace & Prosperity.

[18/07/17, 9:38:31 PM] Moon Pishi: *Kaizen Story: Tiger in the Toilet*

Once a stranded Tiger entered the washroom in a Corporate Office and hid in a dark corner. Since there were people outside the washroom through the day, the Tiger was afraid to come out.

Many people frequented the washroom, but the frightened Tiger didn’t touch anyone. However, after four days it couldn’t bear hunger anymore, so it caught a man who had come in, and ate him. 

This man happened to be an Assistant General Manager in the organization, but nobody noticed his disappearance. 

Since nothing untoward happened, the Tiger became bolder and after two days caught another man and ate him. 

This man was the General Manager of the organization. 

Still, nobody worried over his disappearance (Some people even happy that he was not seen in the office).

Next day, the Tiger caught the Vice President who was a terror in the organization. 

Again nothing happened. The Tiger was very happy and decided that this was the perfect place for him to live. 

The very next day the happy Tiger caught a man who had entered the washroom while balancing a tray of teacups in one hand. 

The frightened man fell unconscious. Within fifteen minutes a huge hue and cry ensued, and everyone in the office started looking for the man. The search team reached the washroom, flushed out the Tiger and saved the unconscious man. He was the tea boy in the office.

*Moral of the Story*

It is not the position, but our usefulness to others that makes us lovable and respectable. _*If your subordinates are happy in your absence that means your not a perfect leader.*_

[19/07/17, 9:56:49 AM] Chordi Pune: *VITAMIN F*

 (I loved this and want to share it with you.)

Why do I have a variety of friends who are all so different in character ? How can I get along with them all?               

I think that each one helps to bring out a "different" part of me.

 * With one of them I am polite.

* I joke with another friend.

* I sit down and talk about serious matters with one.

* With another I laugh a lot.

* I listen to one friend's problems.

* Then I listen to another one's advice for me.

My friends are all like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 
When completed they form a treasure Box !!!

We all pray for each other.

Even Doctors tell us that friends are good for our health.

Dr. Oz calls them *Vitamin F* (for Friends) and counts the benefits of friends as essential to our well being.       

Research shows that people in strong social circles have less risk of depression and terminal strokes.  

If you enjoy *Vitamin F* constantly,  
you can be up to 30 years younger than your real age.  

The warmth of friendship stops stress and even in your most intense moments it decreases the chance of a cardiac arrest or stroke by 50%.

I'm so happy that I have such a huge stock of 
*Vitamin F.*
  
*Thank you dear  for being one of my Vitamins. ..*!!! 💕💕

[31/07/17, 9:43:00 AM] Chordi Pune: When chairman of Infosys foundation sudha Murthy was called "cattle class"
Here's an excerpt from Sudha Murty's 'Three Thousand Stitches: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives' 
Last year, I was at the Heathrow International Airport in London about to board a flight. Usually, I wear a sari even when I am abroad, but I prefer wearing a salwar kameez while travelling. So there I was—a senior citizen dressed in typical Indian apparel at the terminal gate.Since the boarding hadn’t started, I sat down and began to observe my surroundings. The flight was bound for Bengaluru and so I could hear people around me chatting in Kannada. I saw many old married couples of my age—they were most likely coming back from the US or UK after helping their children either through childbirth or a new home. I saw some British business executives talking to each other about India’s progress. Some teenagers were busy with the gadgets in their hands while the younger children were crying or running about the gate.
After a few minutes, the boarding announcement was made and I joined the queue. The woman in front of me was a well-groomed lady in an Indo-Western silk outfit, a Gucci handbag and high heels. Every single strand of her hair was in place and a friend stood next to her in an expensive silk sari, pearl necklace, matching earrings and delicate diamond bangles.I looked at the vending machine nearby and wondered if I should leave the queue to get some water.
Suddenly, the woman in front of me turned sideways and looked at me with what seemed like pity in her eyes. Extending her hand, she asked, ‘May I see your boarding pass, please?’ I was about to hand over my pass to her, but since she didn’t seem like an airline employee, I asked, ‘Why?’ 
‘Well, this line is meant for business class travellers only,’ she said confidently and pointed her finger towards the economy class queue. ‘You should go and stand there,’ she said.
I was about to tell her that I had a business class ticket but on second thoughts, held back. I wanted to know why she had thought that I wasn’t worthy of being in the business class. So I repeated, ‘Why should I stand there?’
She sighed. ‘Let me explain. There is a big difference in the price of an economy and a business class ticket. The latter costs almost two and a half times more than . . .’I think it is three times more,’ her friend interrupted.‘Exactly,’ said the woman. ‘So there are certain privileges that are associated with a business class ticket.’
‘Really?’ I decided to be mischievous and pretended not to know. 
‘What kind of privileges are you talking about?’
She seemed annoyed. ‘We are allowed to bring two bags but you can only take one. We can board the flight from another, less-crowded queue. We are given better meals and seats. We can extend the seats and lie down flat on them. We always have television screens and there are four washrooms for a small number of passengers.’
Her friend added, ‘A priority check-in facility is available for our bags, which means they will come first upon arrival and we get more frequent flyer miles for the same flight.’
‘Now that you know the difference, you can go to the economy line,’ insisted the woman.
‘But I don’t want to go there.’ I was firm.
The lady turned to her friend. ‘It is hard to argue with these cattle-class people. Let the staff come and instruct her where to go. She isn’t going to listen to us.’
I didn’t get angry. The word ‘cattle class’ was like a blast from the past and reminded me of another incident.One day, I had gone to an upscale dinner party in my home city of Bengaluru. Plenty of local celebrities and socialites were in attendance. I was speaking to some guests in Kannada, when a man came to me and said very slowly and clearly in English, ‘May I introduce myself ? I am . . .’
It was obvious that he thought that I might have a problem understanding the language.
I smiled. ‘You can speak to me in English.’
‘Oh,’ he said, slightly flabbergasted. ‘I’m sorry. I thought you weren’t comfortable with English because I heard you speaking in Kannada.’
‘There’s nothing shameful in knowing one’s native language. It is, in fact, my right and my privilege. I only speak in English when somebody can’t understand Kannada.’ 
The line in front of me at the airport began moving forward and I came out of my reverie. The two women ahead were whispering among themselves, ‘Now she will be sent to the other line. It is so long now! We tried to tell her but she refused to listen to us.’
When it was my turn to show my boarding pass to the attendant, I saw them stop and wait a short distance away, waiting to see what would happen. The attendant took my boarding pass and said brightly, ‘Welcome back! We met last week, didn’t we?’
‘Yes,’ I replied.She smiled and moved on to the next traveller.
I walked a few steps ahead of the women intending to let this go, but then I changed my mind and came back.
‘Please tell me—what made you think that I couldn’t afford a business class ticket? Even if I didn’t have one, was it really your prerogative to tell me where I should stand? Did I ask you for help?’
The women stared at me in silence.
‘You refer to the term “cattle class”. Class does not mean possession of a huge amount of money,’ I continued, unable to stop myself from giving them a piece of my mind. 
‘There are plenty of wrong ways to earn money in this world. You may be rich enough to buy comfort and luxuries, but the same money doesn’t define class or give you the ability to purchase it. Mother Teresa was a classy woman. So is Manjul Bhargava, a great mathematician of Indian origin. The concept that you automatically gain class by acquiring money is an outdated thought process.’
I left without waiting for a reply.

[15/08/17, 12:40:05 PM] Chordi Pune: Celebrating In-Dependence


We all want freedom and independence but is it only about having our own house, our own room, our own money and our own decisions. We all seek political, financial, physical and social freedom, but after having it all, are we truly independent? Let us explore our emotional freedom today. To experience independence, a good starting point is to identify our dependencies. If there is anything for which we say I cannot do without or a person for whom we say I cannot live without or a sanskar for which we say It’s not in my control, then we are emotionally dependent. Our basic list of dependencies would include – mobile, internet, television, coffee, alcohol, smoking, particular types of food, shopping etc.
A little more checking will reveal our deeper attachments and dependencies –
1. People and situations should be my way
2. People’s approval and appreciation
3. My opinion is right and yours is wrong
... we can complete the list with all those things for which our mind gets disturbed.

Let’s ask our self do we get hurt or angry always? The answer will be Depends On the person who made the mistake … Depends On what they did … Depends On how they behaved. We believe that our emotions are dependent on who they are and what they did. The truth is it Depends On our state of mind and the response we create irrespective of who they are and what they did. We are enslaved by our own belief systems and it is time to free our self and awaken to a new way of thinking and living. Swa-Rajya means to be a ruler or master over our mind and senses. In-Dependence means to be dependent only on our inner qualities and powers to respond to any behaviour or situation. In-Dependence means we have the power to give blessings to those who betrayed us; we can share and care for those who rejected us; we can co-operate with those who are jealous of us; we can be calm and soft with those who are shouting at us. Let’s create a new belief system - people and situations have No Connection to my response. I have the choice and the power to create the right feeling and behaviour each time and for each one.

I am In-Dependent. 

Happy Independence Day🇨🇮

[20/08/17, 5:34:40 PM] Moon Pishi: Lisa bought a donkey from a farmer for £100. 

The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day.

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

In the morning he drove up and said ...

 'Sorry , but I have some bad news. The donkey died.'

Lisa replied, 'Well just give me my money back then.'

The farmer said, 'Can't do that. I've already spent it.'

Lisa said, ' OK then, just bring me the dead donkey.'

The farmer asked, 'What are you going to do with him?'

Lisa said, 'I'm going to give him off in a lottery prize.'

The farmer said, 'You can't do that with a dead donkey!'

Lisa said, 'Sure I can. Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he's dead.'

A month later, the farmer met up with Lisa and asked, 

'What happened with that dead donkey?'

Lisa said, 'I gave him off in a lottery. 

I sold 500 tickets at £2 each and made a profit of £998.'

The farmer said, 'Didn't anyone complain?'

Lisa said, 'Just the guy who won. So I gave him his £2 back.'

Lisa now works with RELIANCE JIO  as Head of Business Strategy

[29/08/17, 9:44:37 AM] Chordi Pune: "Lexophile" is a term used to describe those who are clever with words, such as "you can tune a piano but you can't tuna fish" , or "to write with a broken pencil is pointless."

A competition to see who can come up with the best lexphillies is held every year in Dubuque, Iowa. The year's winning submissions:

... A thief who stole a calendar got twelve months.

... The batteries were given out free of charge.

... A dentist and a manicurist married. They fought tooth and nail.

... A will is a dead giveaway.

... With her marriage, she got a new name and a dress.

... A boiled egg is hard to beat.

... Police were called to the daycare centre, where a three-year-old was resisting a rest.

.. Did you hear about the fellow whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.

... A bicycle can't stand alone; it is two tired.

... The guy who fell onto an upholstery machine is now fully recovered.

... He had a photographic memory which was never developed.

... When she saw her first strands of grey hair thought she'd dye.

... Acupuncture is a job well done. That's the point of it.

[02/09/17, 2:18:39 AM] Moon Pishi: An engineer in a car manufacturing company designs a world class car. The owner is impressed with the outcome and praised him a lot. 

While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the showroom, they realised that the car is 2 inches taller than the entrance.

The engineer felt bad that he didn't notice this one before creating the car.

The owner was amazed on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area.

The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car which could be touched up later on.

The engineer said that they can break the entrance, take the car out, and later re-do it.

The owner was not convinced with any ideas and felt like it is a bad sign to break or scratch 

A Watchman was observing all the drama & slowly approached the owner.  He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem. 

They wondered what this guy would tell them that the experts could not give.

The watchman said "The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so, Simply release the air in the tyre, the height of the car will sink and can be easily taken out"...

Everyone clapped!!!

Don't analyse the problems only from an expert point of view alone.

There is always a layman's outlook that gives an alternate solution at a given point of time...

Life issues are also the same....

Think Simple...
Do Simple and Live Simple 
Because Originally we are Happy Souls..

Release Some Air (Ego), and Adjust The Height (Attitude).

.           ❤❤❤
I don't think our kids know what a pallu is as mothers now rarely wear saree. The principle use of Ma's pallu was to provide the elegance to her drape. But along with that, it also served as a potholder for removing hot pans from the stove.
❤
It was wonderful for drying children's tears, and on occasion was even used for cleaning out dirty ears and as a hand towel.
❤
For sleeping kids her lap was the mattress and her pallu the warm cover.
❤
When company came, those pallus were ideal hiding places for shy kids..
And when going out as little kids, the pallu became an anchor, a guide to follow the Mom in the big bad world
❤
And when the weather was cold, Maa  wrapped it around her arms.
❤
Those glorious sari pallus wiped many a perspiring brow, bent over the hot wood stove.
❤
Chips and kindling wood were brought into the kitchen in that pallu. It doubled as her apron too
❤
From the garden, it carried all sorts of vegetables. After the peas had been shelled, it carried out the hulls.
❤
In the fall, the pallu was used to bring in berries and sweet scented flowers that had fallen from the trees.
❤
When unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old sari pallu could dust in a matter of seconds.
It carried so many toys, a proper basket
❤
It will be a long time before someone invents something that will replace that 'old-time sari pallu' that served so many purposes.
❤
The pallu is nothing but magic woven.
❤
*And know what this pallu carried.....I don't think I ever caught anything from my MOMS pallu - but love*
               ❤❤❤

আকাশ আমায় শিক্ষা দিল
উদার হতে ভাই রে,
কর্মী হবার মন্ত্র আমি
বায়ুর কাছে পাই রে।

পাহাড় শিখায় তাহার সমান-
হই যেন ভাই মৌন-মহান,
খোলা মাঠের উপদেশে-
দিল-খোলা হই তাই রে।

সূর্য আমায় মন্ত্রণা দেয়
আপন তেজে জ্বলতে,
চাঁদ শিখাল হাসতে মোরে,
মধুর কথা বলতে।

ইঙ্গিতে তার শিখায় সাগর-
অন্তর হোক রত্ন-আকর;
নদীর কাছে শিক্ষা পেলাম
আপন বেগে চলতে।

মাটির কাছে সহিষ্ণুতা
পেলাম আমি শিক্ষা,
আপন কাজে কঠোর হতে
পাষান দিল দীক্ষা।

ঝরনা তাহার সহজ গানে,
গান জাগাল আমার প্রাণে;
শ্যাম বনানী সরসতা
আমায় দিল ভিক্ষা।

বিশ্বজোড়া পাঠশালা মোর,
সবার আমি ছাত্র,
নানান ভাবে নতুন জিনিস
শিখছি দিবারাত্র।

এই পৃথিবীর বিরাট খাতায়,
পাঠ্য যেসব পাতায় পাতায়
শিখছি সে সব কৌতূহলে,
নেই দ্বিধা লেশমাত্র।

[21/09/17, 12:46:49 PM] Partho Jethu: "Article on bongs and pujas by Vir Sanghvi"

............. NOTHING LIKE THE PUJA MAGIC Vir SANGHVI

For a Bombaywallah, Puja is an alien concept. My first experience of how Calcutta shut down during the Puja break came when I was negotiating with Aveek Sarkar for a job at Sunday. For a whole week, I tried in vain to get hold of Aveek. Each time I rang the ABP number, it would ring for two minutes or so till a man would finally pick up, shout 'Pujo' into the receiver and promptly hang up. Later, I discovered - or more correctly, was told - that Puja was Calcutta's answer to Diwali (actually I was told "it is Calcutta's answer to Christmas", but then it was Aveek Sarkar who was choosing the parallels); that something like 40 per cent (or 60 per cent, depending on whose figures you believed) of all retail sales came during that period, and that there were no newspapers for seven days. Over the next ten years - when I lived in Calcutta, first in New Alipore and, then, in Ballygunge - some things did change. The city did not shut down quite as completely. The newspapers did not fail to appear for a week. (I'm not sure how much the ABP operators bothered to change, though.) But the magic of Puja remained. It is hard to explain to somebody who does not know Calcutta - and believe me I have tried - quite how special the Puja period is. North Indians try and find parallels in Dushera; Bombaywallahs treat Ganesh Chaturthi as their equivalent; but somehow, neither approximates the true spirit of Puja. Even now, four years after I've left Calcutta, I still stop and pause each October recalling the smells, sounds and sights of that phase. In some ways, Puja represents the essence of the Bengali character. The pandals themselves, massive great structures, are typically Bengali. In Bombay we build giant Ganpatis and in Delhi we burn effigies of Ravan but nothing prepares you for the magnitude of the pandals. Built with characteristically Bengali artistry, they encompass themes as varied as the Gulf War to Mother Teresa to Sushmita Sen to houses of cards - depending on what has happened that year. Next to the pandals are the smells of the food of Calcutta -sizzling fried fish, eggs frying on rotis for kathi kabab rolls, soya sauce stirfrying in huge woks as Bengali-Chinese noodles are tossed madly into the air and these days, even sambhar simmering in pots as dosas solidify on nearby tawas. And the people! Who can forget the people? Dressed in their finest clothes - five new outfits seems to be a bare minimum for the Puja phase. Milling around the pandals, flowing into the streets in such numbers that there are traffic jams at 3 in the morning. Whole extended families packing into minibuses so they can go from pandal to pandal comparing notes. People from other parts of India are sometimes critical of the Bengali character. Bengalis, they say, spend too much on food; they have too much vanity; they waste their time on artistic pursuits; they take too many days off to celebrate, and so on. In some ways, the critics are right - these are elements of the Bengali temperament. Where I differ with the critics is this: I think these qualities are wonderful. In a society that shuns aesthetics, in a world that prizes money above everything, and in a country where people are increasingly losing touch with human feelings, what could be more wonderful than a warm, artistic, food-loving, non-materialistic, community? For those who love Bengalis and Calcutta, Puja captures the essence of everything we adore. Keep your Diwalis.Keep your Dusheras and keep your Pongals. If you want magic, there is nothing to beat Puja in Calcutta.
[21/09/17, 1:40:29 PM] Chordi Pune: 👏👏👏As a die-hard and proud and food-loving Bengali I agree wholeheartedly....esp with the concluding lines...🤓😍 Pujo in Kolkata create a magic
[21/09/17, 1:41:38 PM] Chordi Pune: Sorry for spell check....it should be 'creates magic'

*হারিয়ে যাচ্ছে সেই সব মানুষেরা যাদের বকুনি শোনার জন্যই মন চাইতো আরো দুষ্টুমি করতে। উৎসবের দিনগুলোয় যাদের ভালোবাসা, আগলে রাখা - আমাদের আবদার আরো  বাড়িয়ে দিতো।দিনের শেষে যাদের ভয়ে অষ্টমীর রাতে তাড়াতাড়ি বাড়ি ফিরতাম। আবার পরদিন সকালেই তাদের হাতে 'নতুন ক্যাপ বন্দুক' দেখে ভুলে যেতাম নতুন জামার আনন্দ। সেই মানুষগুলো একে একে বিদায় নিচ্ছে এই রঙ্গমঞ্চ থেকে। যেন উত্তরসূরীদের হাতে তুলে দিয়ে যাচ্ছে নাটকের পরবর্তী অংকের গুরুদায়িত্ব ॥* 


*আমরা সকলেই সাধারণ, কিন্তু পরিবারের সদস্যদের মধ্যে খুঁজে পাই সেই অসাধারণ মানুষগুলোকে যারা সামনে থাকলে মনে হয় 'না! আর কোনো চিন্তা নেই, সব ঠিক হয়ে যাবে'॥*


*আকাশের দিকে তাকিয়ে ছোটরা যখন জিজ্ঞেস করে "ওই দাদুটা ষ্টার হয়ে গেছে তাই না?" - বুঝে পাই না কি উত্তর দেব ॥* 

*যদি তাই হয়, তাহলে কালো আকাশে যখন তারা খসে, সেই 'দাদু' বা 'দিদুন' রা কি ফিরে আসে কোনো নতুন রূপে সেই উত্তর আজও খুঁজে বেড়াই ॥*


*বছর ঘুরে ফিরে আসে বিজয়া দশমীর বিকেল, কিন্তু ধীরে ধীরে হারিয়ে যাচ্ছে পায়ের সংখ্যা। প্রণামের ইচ্ছে মনের মধ্যেই রয়ে যায়, স্নেহাশীষ রয়ে যায় আকাশের বুকে। তোমরা ভালো থেকো। তাহলেই আমরা ভালো থাকবো ॥*



*শুভ বিজয়ার অনেক অনেক প্রীতি ও শুভেচ্ছা  ॥*

[12/10/17, 10:33:58 AM] Chordi Pune: Story: Nature

One day, all the disciples went to their master' and said, 'Master, Master, we all are going on a pilgrimage.

Master: Why you want to go on a pilgrimage trip?

Disciples: So that we can improve our devotion.

Master: OK. Then do me a favour. Please take this Karela (bitter gourd, a kind of vegetable which is very bitter in taste) along with you and wherever you go and whichever temple you visit, place it in the alter of the Deity, take the blessings and bring it back.

So, not only the disciples but the Karela also went on pilgrimage, temple to temple.

And finally when they came back, the Master said, 'cook that Karela and serve it to me.'

The disciples cooked it and served it to the master. After having the first bite, the master said,

'Surprising'!!!!!

Disciples: What's so surprising?

Master: Even after the pilgrimage the karela is still bitter.
How come?'

Disciples: But that's the very nature of the Karela, Master.

Master: That's what I am saying. Unless you work on your nature, pilgrimage will not make any difference.

So, you & I, if we do not work on ourselves no teacher or guru can make a difference in our lives.

In your thinking,
Sound becomes music,
Movement become dance,
Smile becomes laughter,
Mind becomes meditative and
Life becomes a celebration !

[26/10/17, 1:25:52 PM] Chordi Pune: I was waiting at a traffic light to cross the road with Haruki, a Japanese friend. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon in a small town on the Tokyo outskirts and there was not a vehicle or soul in sight. So I turned to Haruki and said, “Hey, I know it's a red but should we just cross?”

Haruki looked at me and shook his head. “No, we wait for the green.”

I was a bit perplexed - it did not seem to me that it would make any difference whether we waited or not. “There aren't any cars. Why do we need to wait?”

Haruki smiled, then asked me a question in return: “What if a child is watching?”

***

Now I know what they mean when they say it takes a village to raise a child.

A man died...

When he realized it, he saw God coming closer with a suitcase in his hand.

Dialog between God and Dead Man:

God: *Alright son, it’s time to go*

Man: So soon? I had a lot of plans...

God: *I am sorry but, it’s time to go*

Man: What do you have in that suitcase?

God: *Your belongings*

Man: My belongings? You mean my things... Clothes... money...

God; *Those things were never yours, they belong to the Earth*

Man: Is it my memories?

God: *No. They belong to Time*

Man: Is it my talent?

God: *No. They belong to Circumstance*

Man: Is it my friends and family?

God: *No son. They belong to the Path you travelled*

Man: Is it my wife and children?

God: *No. they belong to your Heart*

Man: Then it must be my body

God: *No No... It belongs to Dust*

Man: Then surely it must be my Soul!

God: *You are sadly mistaken son. Your Soul belongs to me.*

Man with tears in his eyes and full of fear took the suitcase from the God's hand and opened it...

Empty...

With heartbroken and tears down his cheek he asks God...

Man: I never owned anything?

God: *That’s Right. You never owned anything*.

Man: Then? What was mine?

God: your *MOMENTS*. 
Every moment you lived was *yours*.

Do Good in every moment
Think Good in every moment
Thank God for every moment

Life is just a Moment.

Live it...
Love it...
Enjoy it...... Pls share this beautiful message with everyone to know the meaning of life ❤
[06/11/17, 11:49:58 AM] Chordi Pune: Reunion Special: Read it😀😊😬😄😳

Have you ever been guilty of looking at others your own age and thinking, "surely I can't look that old.". Well . . . you'll love this one..The stuff is from a lady called Archana

"My name is Archana. I was sitting in the waiting room for my first appointment with a new dentist.

I noticed his BDS degree on the wall, which bore his full name.

Suddenly, I remembered a tall , handsome, dark-haired boy with the same name had been in my high school class some 25-odd years ago.

Could he be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then?

Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This balding, gray-haired man with the deeply lined face was way too old to have been my classmate.

After he examined my teeth, I asked him if he had attended St Xavier's high school.

"Yes. yes, I did.' he gleamed with pride.

"When did you graduate?" I asked.

He answered, "In 1987. Why do you ask?"

"You were in my class!!!!", I exclaimed.

He looked at me closely.

Then, 
that
ugly,
old,
bald,
wrinkled faced,
gray-haired,
decrepit,
idiot,
asked,

"What subject did you teach" ?" 😍😍😍😛😛😛😜😜😜

[05/12/17, 6:59:15 PM] Moon Pishi: Please look at the speech that was read yesterday at retirement by the Pope.
Regardless of religion, see how Pope Francis has beautifully written about the family.

FAMILY, PLACE OF FORGIVENESS ...

©  There is no perfect family.
©  We do not have perfect parents,
- we are not perfect,
We do not marry a perfect person or we do not have perfect children.
©  We have complaints from each other.
©  We are constantly disappointed.
©  There is no healthy marriage or healthy family without the exercise of forgiveness.
©  Forgiveness is vital to our emotional health and spiritual survival. Without forgiveness, the family becomes an arena of conflict and a fortress of evil.
©  Without forgiveness, the family becomes sick.
©  Forgiveness is the asepsis of the soul, the purification of the spirit and the liberation of the heart.
 He who does not forgive does not have peace in his soul or communion with God.
©  Evil is a poison that intoxicates and kills.
©  Keeping heartache in your heart is a self-destructive gesture. It's autophagy.
©  Those who do not forgive are physically, emotionally and spiritually ill.
For this reason, the family must be a place of life and not a place of death;
 a place of paradise and not a place of hell;
A healing territory and not a disease;
 an internship of forgiveness and not guilt.
 Forgiveness brings joy where sorrow has brought sadness; of the
Healing where sorrow has caused the disease.

¤ Pope Francis

Please send to all the families you know. This could help extinguish some family battles!
[05/12/17, 7:36:18 PM] Chordi Pune: So true! With forgiveness we let go of the feeling of hurt that we create within ourselves causing sorrow and disease.

1. At 15 or 65, you are still a *“Dada”*
2. New market is *still new* after decades..!
3. If you don’t find a book in College Street, *probably it doesn’t exist..!*
4. If you are wondering where the next bus-stop is.. just signal the bus to stop with *your hands..!*
5. On public transport, no matter how crowded it is - *“Ektu chepe!”*
6. Only city where the bus conductor gets to hear *“Dicchi..! Dicchi..!”*
7. Taxi meters *run faster than* the vehicle itself..!
8. Want to take a walk? If you aren’t married go to *Victoria*, if you are married go to *South City Mall..!*
9. It’s not Tollygunge.. It’s *Taligonj*
10. Everyone has a friend who is from *South Point.*
11. Origin of the oldest metro in India. So, *“Metro niye kotha hobe na”*
12. What we pray when KKR plays, *“Aaj shalaa brishti hok..!”*
13. Bandh = *“Yayyy, family time!”*
14. Want to date a Kolkata girl? Just say, *“Fuchka khabe?”*
15. No matter how spicy the fuchka masala is *“Arektu jhaal dao toh”*
16. The first Bangla a non-bong learns *“Ami tomake bhalobashi”.*
 (After Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Devdas that has changed it to *“Eeshhh.. Sotti..!?”*)
17. “Restaurant” = *“Hotel”*; & “Shopping”= *“Marketing”*
18. Joggers wear monkey caps in the first week of November *“Oh bhishon thanda porey geche dada!”*
19. In the course of a heated discussion, a Bengali gunda threatens *“Dada, eta kintu bhalo hocche na.. bole dicchi!”*
20. *Calcutta Is Kolkata.., Still Calcuttian Is Everywhere..!* 😂😍
[31/12/17, 12:36:37 PM] Chordi Pune: _*Drinking From The Saucer*_
_John Paul Moore_

I've never made a fortune,
and I'll never make one now...
but it really doesn't matter
'cause I'm happy anyhow...

As I go along my journey,
I'm reaping better than I've sowed...
I'm drinking from the saucer...
'cause my cup has overflowed... 

I don't have a lot of riches,
and the going's sometimes tough...
but with kin and friends to love me...
I think I'm rich enough... 

I thank God for the blessings,
that His mercy has bestowed...
as I'm drinking from the saucer
'cause my cup has overflowed... 

He gives me strength and courage,
when the way grows steep and rough...
I'll not ask for other blessings,
for I'm already blessed enough...

May we never be too busy
to help bear another's load... then we'll all be drinking from the saucer,
when our cups have overflowed...
_*as we are on the cusp of a New Year... my wish is that 'may your cup always overflow'. God Bless*_

Ahista chal zindagi, abhi kai karz chukana baaki hai.


Kuch dard mitana baaki hai, kuch farz nibhana baaki hai.


Raftaar mein tere chalne se kuchh rooth gaye, kuch chhut gaye.


Roothon ko manana baaki hai, roton ko hasana baki hai.


Kuch hasraatein abhi adhuri hain, kuch kaam bhi aur zaruri hai.


Khwahishen jo ghut gayi is dil mein, unko dafnana baki hai.


Kuch rishte ban kar toot gaye, kuch judte-judte chhut gaye.


Un tootte-chhutte rishton ke zakhmon ko mitana baki hai.


Tu aage chal main aata hoon, kya chhod tujhe ji paunga?


In saanson par haqq hai jinka, unko samjhaana baaki hai.


Aahista chal zindagi, abhi kai karz chukana baki hai...


May 2018 bring happiness and contentment.

[04/01/18, 4:38:47 PM] Moon Pishi: Just for information 
Many years ago, there was a big fire at a five-star hotel (J. P. Hotel) in upscale Vasant Vihar. So many people died. But the Japanese and Americans guests at the hotel survived. Why? Because they put wet towels under the doors so that no smoke enters their rooms. They put wet handkerchiefs on their faces and lay on the floor, as the smoke moved up. Most deaths are caused because of smoke inhalation, not fire. Most Indians in the building jumped out of their windows and many died. The critical difference has to do with training. General public should be  made aware of what to do and how to behave in case of fire.

Be Alert, be vigilant, be smart...🙏

[12/01/18, 11:57:19 AM] Chordi Pune: Did you know that at Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the most popular and successful course teaches you how to learn to be happier?

 The Positive Psychology class taught by Ben Shahar attracts 1400 students per semester and 20% of Harvard graduates take this elective course.

According to Ben Shahar, the class - which focuses on happiness, self-esteem and motivation - gives students the tools to succeed and face life with more joy._This 35-year-old teacher, considered by some to be "the happiness guru", highlights in his class 14 key tips for improving the quality of our personal status and contributing to a positive life:

🚩Tip 1. *Thank God for everything you have*:  Write down 10 things you have in your life that give you happiness. Focus on the good things!
🚩Tip 2. *Practice physical activity* Experts say exercising helps improve mood. 30 minutes of exercise is the best antidote against sadness and stress.
🚩Tip 3. *Breakfast:* Some people miss breakfast for lack of time or not to get fat. Studies show that breakfast gives you energy, helps you think and perform your activities successfully.
🚩Tip 4. *Be Assertive*: Ask what you want and say what you think. Being assertive helps improve your self-esteem. Being left and remaining silent creates sadness and hopelessness.
🚩Tip 5. *Spend your money on experiences*..a study found that 75% of people felt happier when they invested their money in travel, courses and classes; While only the rest said they felt happier when buying things.
🚩Tip 6. *Face your challenges*: Studies show that the more you postpone something, the more anxiety and tension you generate. Write short weekly lists of tasks and complete them.
🚩Tip 7. *Put everywhere nice memories, phrases and photos of your loved ones*: Fill your fridge, your computer, your desk, your room, YOUR LIFE of beautiful memories.
🚩Tip 8. *Always greet and be nice to other people*: More than 100 inquiries state that just smiling changes the mood.
🚩Tip 9. *Wear comfortable shoes*: If your feet hurt you, you become moody, says Dr. Keinth Wapner, President of the American Orthopedics Association.
🚩Tip 10. *Take care of your posture*: Walk straight with your shoulders slightly backwards and the front view helps to maintain a good mood.
🚩Tip 11. *Listen to music* (Praise God): It is proven that listening to music awakens you to sing, this will make your life happy.
🚩Tip 12. *What you eat has an impact on your mood*:- Do not skip meals, eat lightly every 3 to 4 hours and keep glucose levels stable.- Avoid excess white flour and sugar.- Eat everything! Healthy- Vary your food.
🚩Tip 13. *Take care of yourself and feel attractive*:70% of people say they feel happier when they think they look good.
🚩Tip 14. *Fervently believe in God*: With him nothing is impossible! 

Happiness is like a remote control, we lose it every time, we go crazy looking for it and many times without knowing it, we are sitting on top of it ... 👍👍🙏
[12/01/18, 7:33:51 PM] Chordi Pune: *Beautiful explanation by Swami Vivekananda*:
Explaining the meaning of ‘Association’ he said:..“A rain drop from the sky: if it is caught by clean hands, is pure enough for drinking. If it falls in the gutter, its value drops so much that it can’t be used even for washing your feet. If it falls on a hot surface, it will evaporate... If it falls on a lotus leaf, it shines like a pearl and finally, if it falls on an oyster, it becomes a pearl...The drop is the same, but its existence & worth depends on whom it is associated with.”...Always be associated with people who are good at heart..You will experience your own inner transformation"...
Send this to all people with a beautiful heart💓 whom you wish to be associated with....

I just did 👍🏾

[17/01/18, 8:20:47 PM] Moon Pishi: 🐜An ant knocked on the door of a house.

The house owner opened the door.

"I want a place to stay," said the ant.

"I have a vacant room which you can occupy for free of cost," said the owner.

The ant went inside and occupied the vacant room.

After some days, the ant brought in another ant 🐜and requested the
owner, "Can you please allow this ant to stay with me?"

"Oh sure, you can do so without paying any rent," said the owner.

After some days the ant brought a 3rd 🐜ant and requested the owner
to allow it to stay with them.

The owner agreed to it without asking for any rent.

This went on as the 🐜ant brought in more and more ants and the owner agreed to let them stay without any rent.

One fine day, the ant brought in the  *10th* ant 🐜and requested the owner
to allow it to stay with them all.

The owner said, 
"OK, you can all stay here but now you all need to pay rent."

*Now the question is:*

Why did the owner ask for rent when the 10th ant came in?

[20/01/18, 9:57:10 AM] Chordi Pune: *How Emotions Affect Our Health*

Every cell in our body is intelligent to think and act. We have *60 trillion* cells in our body and our health depends a lot on the harmonic balance and cohesion of the cells with each other.

In the movie _Eat, Pray, Love_, Julia Roberts visits a wise man in Bali, and he advises her not to try too hard to meditate. In fact, he suggests that meditation is nothing but smiling and the line that is a kicker, is "Smile with your liver." 

If you believe that this is just a metaphor, lets look at the other end of the spectrum to prove just how crucial this is. 

Let us say you hold a negative emotion towards somebody, something or some event in your life. Each time you think of that your whole body re-lives the emotional upheaval of that association.

Your mind doesn't have a mind of its own, and doesn't know if the event is happening in real time or it is being replayed. So it produces the same stress hormones each time. Each and every cell of your body starts feeling the same emotion, of let us say "hatred" towards that event, person or experience all over again.

The body is not at ease. This is a state where the condition of disease sets in.

If you continue to live in that state, your cells are now getting conditioned to live in the same state. 
The Upanishads talk about *"Yatha Pinde Tatha Brahmande"* ...as is the atom so is the universe.

The health of a person depends on how well all the systems of the body and the *60 trillion cells* play the melody of harmony together. 

When the cells are living in a state of hatred, they soon start exhibiting that with each other and killing healthy cells in the body. This leads to many forms of auto immune disease.

Like Rumi said, "you are not a drop in the ocean, you are an ocean in every drop". 

Be careful of your thoughts, your feelings and your emotions.

*Forgive people, not because they deserve it, but because you need it. Stay happy, stay healthy.* Have a wonderful healthy life ahead filled with the abundance of good health and happiness.

*HAPPINESS  TO ALL*

[02/02/18, 6:58:15 PM] Moon Pishi: A True and Moving Story

A sobbing little girl stood near a small church from which she had been turned away because it was too crowded. "I can't go to Sunday School?" she sobbed to the pastor as he walked by. Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday school class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus.

Some two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings and the parents called for the kind hearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements.

As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read, "This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday school."

For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He challenged his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building.

But the story does not end there! A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents. Church members made large donations. Cheques came from far and wide.

Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00--a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her unselfish love had paid large dividends.

When you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300 and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday school children, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during Sunday school time. In one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable history. Alongside of it is a portrait of her kind pastor, Dr. Russell H. Conwell, author of the book, Acres of Diamonds.

A true story, which goes to show WHAT GOD, CAN DO with 57 cents. Please forward this to those friends who would receive a blessing from reading this true story.

[24/02/18, 6:29:05 PM] Chordi Pune: 7 short stories shared by Satya Nadella 
[CEO Microsoft]

🌾 *LOOKING BACK*
I interviewed my grandmother for part of a research paper I’m working on for my Psychology class. When I asked her to define success in her own words, she said, “Success is when you look back at your life and the memories make you smile."

🌾 *LOVE CONQUERS PAIN*
After I watched my dog get run over by a car, I sat on the side of the road holding him and crying. And just before he died, he licked the tears off my face.

🌾 *TOGETHERNESS*
As my father, three brothers, and two sisters stood around my mother’s hospital bed, my mother uttered her last coherent words before she died. She simply said, “I feel so loved right now. We should have gotten together like this more often.”

🌾 *AFFECTION*
I kissed my dad on the forehead as he passed away in a small hospital bed. About 5 seconds after he passed, I realized it was the first time I had given him a kiss since I was a little boy.

🌾 *JOY*
When I witnessed a 27-year-old cancer patient laughing hysterically at her 2-year-old daughter’s antics, I suddenly realized that I need to stop complaining about my life and start celebrating it again.

🌾 *KINDNESS*
A boy in a wheelchair saw me desperately struggling on crutches with my broken leg and offered to carry my backpack and books for me. He helped me all the way across campus to my class and as he was leaving he said, “I hope you feel better soon.”

🌾 *SHARING*
I was traveling in Kenya and I met a refugee from Zimbabwe. He said he hadn’t eaten anything in over 3 days and looked extremely skinny and unhealthy. Then my friend offered him the rest of the sandwich he was eating. The first thing the man said was, “We can share it.”

*Celebrate Life with Gratitude*

[24/03/18, 9:10:19 AM] ‪+91 98302 67133‬: Glum-faced Gluttonous by Sukumar Ray 

Glum-faced Gluttonous - taciturn, pompous, 
Hails from Bengal, surely. 
Why is he so grim? Try and live with him 
You'll pay through your nose most dearly. 
His single relation, is Uncle Shyamadas 
Who's but a seller of opium 
Is that why he sits still, pale-faced, though he will, 
Now and then show his opprobrium? 
Though once he would prance, clap and even dance 
His songs full of energy and vim Always full of bliss, the chap would never miss 
A chance to sing, "Sa-re-ga-ma, Tim-tim.”
But one day at high noon, when he was in his room 
Eating his bananas raw and mashed, 
Did Glumface get bit? Did Shyamadas cop it? 
Or did he get a leg or two smashed? 
'That's not what happened!' Glumface thunders 
'Something makes me ponder - 
Fleas quick or lame, how to get rid of 'em
And not make one big blunder. 
If they sit to the right, then I just might 
With my right tail give a swat 
To the left perchance, if I see 'em prance 
The other tail can hit 'em like a cricket bat. 
But if some prankster, sits in between 
It puts me in a dilemma that's grave; 
Which tail to use on this abuse? 
A third tail is what I then crave.'

[24/03/18, 10:23:50 AM] ‪+91 98302 67133‬: Came to know from Posta visit,
Your daughter’s marriage, is it?
Gangaram, the groom-to-be?
Want to know, Sir, how is he?
Not bad at all, he has spark!
Complexion, though, is pitch dark.
Moreover, the shape of his face
Is of an owl, more or less.
Education? Oh, wait, listen,
What a noble persuasion!
To cross ‘matric’ he had aimed.
Stopped after nineteenth attempt.
Financially, a bit poor.
Two meals a day’re not sure.
His brothers would make a mark;
One’s mad, the other is jerk!
The third one is out in bail;
He xeroxed notes and went to jail.
The youngest brother plays the drum
In theatres for a paltry sum.
Ganga himself suffers a lot
From hepatitis and what not!
But they belong to upper caste.
King Kangsho was their distant past.
Shyam Lahiri from Banagram
Is related to this Gangaram.
Got the gem of a son-in-law.
Not bad, not a single flaw!

[28/03/18, 10:10:29 PM] Moon Pishi: Just recd this beautiful write up in another group. Felt like sharing with you all 👇

Dr laha - 

The contact and connection - 

Year 1990. I was returning from Delhi by flight with a monk of  RamKrishna Mission. One  journalist from Chile was there with us . He was to take an interview of the monk. 
Journalist - dear Sir , in your last lecture u told about jogajog ( contact ) &  Sanjog (connection ). It's really confusing. Can u explain to me ?
Monk smiled a little but deviating from question he asked - are u from Chile ?
Journalist( J ) - yeh...
Monk ( M ) - who are there at home ? 
Journalist thought Monk is trying to avoid his question... this is a very personal and unwarranted question . yet Journalist  said -  mother expired. father is there. 3 brothers one sister. All married...
Monk was cool and still a smile in face further asked - do u talk to your father ???
Now Journalist was visibly annoyed...
M - when did u talk to him last ??? 
J - supressing his annoyance said - may be a month back. 
M - Do u brothers and sisters meet often ? When did u last meet as a family together ???
At this point I saw the journalist's sweat on fore head....
Who is taking whose interview ? Seemed ,  the monk is taking interview of journalist...
With a sigh , the journalist said - we met last in Christmas 2 yrs back..
Monk - how many days u stayed together ? 
J - ( wiping the sweat) 3 days...
M - how much time u spent with father sitting beside him ?
I saw the journalist perplexed and embrassed.... scribbling something on a paper...
M - did u have breakfast or lunch or dinner together ? Did u asked how is he ? Did u ask how his days are passing after your mother's death ?
I saw the journalist's eyes heavy...looking out side at the sky...
Monk still cool and smile in his face placed his hand on journalist's hand and said
M - don't be embrassed or upset or sad. I am sorry if I have hurt u unknowingly...
But this is basically your answer to contact and connection ( jogajog and Sanjog). 
M - u have contact with father but u don't have connection with him. U are not connected to him. Connection is by heart to heart... sitting together , sharing , caring , hugging each other , touch , shake hand , eye contact , sharing food from same plate , spending little time together...
M - u all brothers and sisters have contact but there is no connection with anybody....

This is the realty in present world. 
In home , society and everywhere everybody has lots and lots of contact but there is no connection. No communication...   . Everybody is in virtual world. 
The journalist wiped his eyes and said - thanks for teaching me a lesson. 

I came back to my sense.....
In our childhood when we travelled in train , bus or flight .... everyone used smile to everyothers... then talking to each other, sharing each other in short journey. Some used to be frnds. Some used to be uncle and aunty for life long....
And now when I travel by train or by flight , I just enter into a cemetery.... no one disturbs no one. All are busy with a fone or laptop with some " tik tik tik tik tik sound ...like it is in cemetery with sound of falling dry leaves...
Everybody in This compartment are in contact with whole world but no one knows copsaaengers... -  Its a cemetery of some 50 - 100  "living dead " persons in a small journey..

Let's not be well contacted - let's be well connected , well communicated with  caring , sharing , touch , hug , spending time together ....

God bless.

[01/04/18, 1:27:52 PM] Papa: Possibility 1:
The journalist has presented half of the interview. Initially it did have pride. Every day Mr Pot was afraid that it would break. And then they would make him into pieces and throw back into mix. Loss of existence - oh such difficult, so what happens to me? When it didn’t have an answer, fear of dying increased. Water started to smell. All said no point, get a new Mr Pot. Then when all give up, then he said this.

Possibility 2:
Mr Pot had gone through so many recycling that it was aware of each molecule of mud is on its own. Just happened to be together. But then read Albert’s controversy comments that God does not play Dice, read a bit of Hisenberg’s probalistic  vs deterministic theories. Read gravity, friction, also quantum mechanics, stats. Got more confused. At death bed told this to the nurse.
[01/04/18, 1:28:59 PM] Papa: Apologies. Sorry for the nonsense.
[01/04/18, 1:43:13 PM] Partho Jethu: In either case the pot's statement is based on its own experience n realisation. It is for us to infer n determine if it works for us.
[01/04/18, 2:13:18 PM] Papa: Realisation or Illusion? Sab kuch Maya
[01/04/18, 3:10:22 PM] ‪+44 7500 455661‬: Bubai dada who's Maya? 😛
[01/04/18, 3:17:51 PM] Mama: He is having his Sunday's nap. Once he is awake  he will give you the answer😛

[01/04/18, 3:38:36 PM] Mama: 😂
[01/04/18, 3:58:18 PM] Chordi Pune: The ultimate realisation through one's journey is what matters, doesn't  it?
[01/04/18, 4:00:32 PM] Chordi Pune: That was the realisation when the pot decided that pride and anger are futile....ploys of maya
[01/04/18, 4:03:34 PM] Papa: Rumna, Maya in old Vedic text is wisdom, but in later decades defines as Illusion like Optional illusion as Mirage in desert. What you see is not what it is, and what IT is you just don’t see. Reality is not real and Dream may be true.
[01/04/18, 4:28:25 PM] Papa: There is surely a continuation of the journey for every individual, so it is really not Illusion. It is more deterministic than probabilistic, but science is still not there. See some research below

[03/04/18, 4:20:25 PM] Chordi Pune: লুচি

দুধ-সাদাটে বর্ণ আমার
ফুলকো নরম দেহ,
গোলগাল এই নধর শরীর
চিনতে পারো কেহ?

ময়দা মেখে কায়দা করে
চাকীর ওপর বেলে,
গাওয়া ঘিয়ে হালকা ভেজে
আলতো করে তোলে।

সঙ্গে থাকে গরম তেলে
লম্বা বেগুন ভাজা,
কুমড়ো আলুর ছক্কা খেয়ে
সবাই যে তরতাজা!

খায় যদি কেউ ডুবিয়ে আমায়
কচি পাঁঠার ঝোলে,
মাংসের স্বাদ তখন দেখো
কেমন দারুণ খোলে।

নরম নরম গরম বোঁদের
সঙ্গে যখন আসি,
ডায়বিটিসের রোগীর মুখেও
ফুটিয়ে তুলি হাসি।

ভালো ঘিয়ের গন্ধ মেখে
বিয়ের ভোজের রাতে,
ছোলার ডালে গা এলিয়ে
দেখা যে দেই পাতে।

পয়রা গুড়ের সঙ্গে আছি
কিংবা রসগোল্লা,
সবার সাথেই অবাধ গতি
অটুট আমার জেল্লা।

রোববারে তে জলখাবারে
ডুবিয়ে আলুর দমে,
তৃপ্তি যে আর হয়না কারো
দশ বারোটার কমে।

সব রকমের কর্মে আছি
সকল শুভ কাজে,
বঙ্গকূলের রান্নাঘরে
সবাই আমায় ভজে।

কোলেষ্টেরল যতই বাড়ুক
তাও আমাতেই রুচি,
সব বাঙালীর ভীষণ প্রিয়
আমি হলেম লুচি!
[03/04/18, 7:45:41 PM] Papa: Well written, though many may not be able to read. Fully agree on everything. And then if no stress, no diseases also.

[05/04/18, 10:58:53 AM] Chordi Pune: *_REACTING TO EVERYTHING ..._*

Sudha Murthy's take on life, trials and tribulations:

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_* 
I Don’t Have To React To 'Everything' That Bothers Me.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
I don’t have to hurt those who hurt me.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Maybe the 'ultimate' sign of maturity is walking away instead of getting even.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
The energy it takes to react to every bad thing that happens to you drains you and stops you from seeing the other good things in life.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
I’m not going to be everyone’s cup of tea.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
I won’t be able to get everyone to treat me the way I want to be treated.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Trying so hard to ‘win’ anyone is just a 'waste' of time and energy and it fills you with 'nothing' but emptiness.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Not reacting doesn’t mean I’m okay with things, 
It just means I’m choosing to 'rise' above it. 

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Sometimes 'not' saying anything at all says everything.'

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Reacting to things that upset you gives someone else power over 'your' emotions.

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Even if I react, 
It won’t change anything, 
It won’t make people suddenly love and respect me, 
It won’t magically change their minds. 

*_I’m Slowly Learning That :-_*
Life is 'better lived' when you 'don’t' center it on what’s happening around you and 'center it on' what’s happening 'inside you' instead.

*_'Work' on yourself and your inner peace and you’ll come to 'realize' that 'not' reacting to every little thing that bothers you is the 'first ingredient' to living a happy and healthy life._*

But see how beautiful the roads and buildings look

[08/04/18, 8:00:27 AM] Chordi Pune: Jokes aside Bubai....Bombay aka Mumbai was truly such a beautiful place even when I first came there (even though there we're no trams) and the houses and roads fascinated me!  It has transformed (perhaps degenerated) over the years....yet managed to retain its spirit! 
I have very fond memories of my early years for so many other reasons as well....❤
For me....truly 🎼Woh tha Mumbai, meri jaan🎼🎼🤗
[08/04/18, 8:42:45 AM] Laila Jethima: Though the city has  degenerated with horrendous traffic and population it still has its charm and definitely home for me
[08/04/18, 11:10:56 AM] Chordi Pune: 👍😍
[08/04/18, 11:30:52 AM] Papa: Once early morning I took taxi from Race Course to WTC after having parked my car at office. Asked driver by chance (as I had just finished BF) - nashta kiya kya? Came reply - Nehi. Aap se dhandha chalu. saab, ye shahar me hum bhuke huthte hai, kekin bhuke sote nehi. Bombay is good as long as you are in business, needs are name, fame, power... Shiv Sena, Ambanis, all stars.
But one day when you neither have that nor the youth, then the city would treat you worthless.

Lakhimashi - love you and miss you.

[12/04/18, 9:37:35 PM] Moon Pishi: This is from Dr. Geetha Krishnaswamy, Please give your 2min and read this:-

1. Let’s say it’s 7:45pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.

2. You’re really tired, upset and frustrated. 

3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.

4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.

5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.

6. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only
about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. 

7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing
repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. 

A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two
seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until
the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

8. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing
movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. 

9. Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!

10. A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail
kindly send it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.

11. Rather than sending jokes, please..contribute by forwarding this mail which can save a person’s life….

12. If this message comes around you ……more than once…..please don’t get irritated……U need to be happy that you have many friends who care about you & being reminded of how to tackle….Heart attacks….AGAIN…

From: 
DR.N Siva
(Senior Cardiologist)

Copy and paste...
U might save lives..😊
Pls don't mind repetition☺

[23/04/18, 6:09:39 PM] Papa: This excerpt from Carl Sagan's book Pale Blue Dot (1994) was inspired by an image taken, at Sagan's suggestion, by  Voyager1 on Feb 14, 1990, from a distance of about 6 billion kms.  

 Voyager1, which had completed its primary mission and was leaving the Solar System, was commanded by NASA to turn its camera around and take one last photo of Earth across a great expanse of space, at the request of Carl Sagan. 

The accompanying words,  though written 27 yrs ago are still or rather more relevant today.

👇🏽👇🏽 A MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE 👇👇

A must Watch....

--সাঁওতাল পরগণা গেছিলেন কোনোদিন?
--গেছিলাম তো। গত শীতেই এক সন্ধেবেলায়। ফিরে এসেছি পরদিন সকালেই।

--একটা সকালেই দেখা হয়ে গেলো সব!!
--হ্যাঁ, হয়ে গেলো, আর কিছু দেখার ছিলো না।

--ব্যাপারটা কি বলুন তো,কিছু কি হয়েছিলো আপনার? 
--হ্যাঁ, হয়েছিলো। 

স্টেশনে পৌঁছে উঠেছিলাম কাছাকাছি একটা গেস্ট হাউসে। থাকার ইচ্ছেও ছিলো হপ্তাখানেক। জানোই তো, বড্ড চায়ের নেশা আমার। তাই, রাত শেষ হতেই মাফলার সোয়েটার জড়িয়ে গেলুম মোড়ের মাথায় চায়ের দোকানে। 
ভিড় নেই। খুবই শীত তখন। এক বৃদ্ধ ভদ্রলোক এক গ্লাস চা নিয়ে বসেছিলেন, গায়ে বেশ ভারি আর দামি কাশ্মীরি শাল। দোকানের ঠিক বাইরেই এক বয়স্কা মহিলা বসে আছেন ভিক্ষের প্রত্যাশায়। 
একটা ছেঁড়া শাড়ি, গায়ে চাদর-টাদর কিচ্ছু নেই, শীতে ঠকঠক করে কাঁপছেন। অভ্যাসবশতই হাত চলে গিয়েছিলো পকেটে। একটা কয়েন ছুঁড়ে দিলুম মহিলাটির বাটিতে। বৃদ্ধ হেসে উঠলেন। অকারণ অট্টহাসি। একটু বিরক্ত হয়েই চা টোস্টের অর্ডার দিয়ে বেঞ্চিতে বৃদ্ধের সঙ্গে বেশ দূরত্ব রেখেই বসলাম। 
একটু পরে বেশ গম্ভীর গলাতেই প্রশ্ন করলেন তিনি-- মশায় কি বাঙালি? বেড়াতে এসেছেন? কী নাম আপনার?  
উত্তর দিলুম। বৃদ্ধ হাসলেন।

সৌজন্যবশতই প্রশ্ন করলাম, .---আপনিও কি বেড়াতে এসেছেন? আপনার নাম কী? 
উত্তর দিলেন না, উলটে রীতিমতো বিদ্রূপের হাসি নিয়ে জিজ্ঞেস করলেন আমাকে ---তা মশায়ের লেখাপড়া কদ্দুর? স্নাতক? 
বেশ ক্ষিপ্ত হয়েই জবাব দিয়েছিলুম ---আমি কলেজে পড়াই।
--- অ! তাহলে তো স্নাতকোত্তর। বিদ্যের জাহাজ বললেই চলে!---

প্রতিটি শব্দ কাঁটা হয়ে ফুটছে আমার বুকে। চায়ের গ্লাস রেখে এবার তিনি উঠে দাঁড়ালেন। 

কিছু বলার সুযোগ না দিয়েই স্মিত হেসে বললেন আমাকে ---আপনি স্নাতক নন। স্নান সমাপ্ত না হলে কেউ স্নাতক হয় না। 
শুনুন, তৈত্তিরীয় উপনিষদে একটা মন্ত্র আছে---- "শ্রদ্ধয়া দেয়ম্। অশ্রদ্ধয়া অদেয়ম্। শ্রিয়া দেয়ম্। হ্রিয়া দেয়ম্। ভিয়া দেয়ম্। সংবিদা দেয়ম্।" 
মুহূর্তে বজ্রকঠিন হয়ে উঠলো বৃদ্ধের কণ্ঠস্বর--এভাবে টাকা ছুঁড়ে ভিক্ষা কখনো দেবেন না আর ---যদি দিতে ইচ্ছে হয় কখনো, শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে দেবেন, অশ্রদ্ধাভরে দেবেন না, সবিনয়ে দেবেন, কুণ্ঠিত হয়ে দেবেন, সমগ্র সত্তা দিয়ে দেবেন ---বলেই বেরিয়ে গেলেন বৃদ্ধ। 
দোকানের বাইরে দাঁড়িয়ে সেই মহিলাকে বললেন--মা একটু উঠে দাঁড়ান তো। গা থেকে মহার্ঘ শালটা খুলে অতি যত্নে জড়িয়ে দিলেন বৃদ্ধার গায়ে। স্তম্ভিত আমার দিকে ফিরে দাঁড়িয়ে কাটা কাটা গলায় বললেন-বেড়াতে আসিনি, এখানেই থাকি আমি। বাঙালি সম্ভবত নই , সম্ভবত ঘৃণাই করি জাতটাকে। আর  আমার নাম *ঈশ্বরচন্দ্র বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়*। 

মুহূর্তে  পৃথিবী দুলে উঠলো আমার চোখের সামনে।। টাল সামলে সসম্ভ্রমে উঠে দাঁড়াবার আগেই দেখলুম  বৃদ্ধ এগিয়ে গেছেন বহুদূর। যতদূর তিনি চলেছেন ততদূর পর্যন্ত নিষ্পত্র গাছগুলোতে ফুটে উঠছে অশোক, পলাশ, কৃষ্ণচূড়া। যতদূর তিনি চলেছেন, আকাশ জুড়ে শঙ্খধ্বনি শুনতে পাচ্ছি। শুনছি সমুদ্রগর্জন। স্পষ্ট দেখছি উত্তাল সমুদ্রের ঢেউ তাঁকে আনত হয়ে প্রণাম করে ফিরে যাচ্ছে; আর আমার চোখের সামনে তখন উন্মোচিত হচ্ছে মহাভারতের মহানাটকের এক দৃশ্যপট। 
*"স্নানম্ চ কিম্ পরম্ প্রোক্তং"-যক্ষরূপী ধর্ম প্রশ্ন করছেন যুধিষ্ঠিরকে-স্নান কী? "স্নানম্ মনোমলত্যাগো"-সসম্ভ্রমে যক্ষকে উত্তর দিচ্ছেন ধর্মপুত্র-বালতি বালতি জল ঢালা নয়, মনোমল ত্যাগ করাকেই স্নান বলা হয়।*

একমুহূর্তও দাঁড়াবার সাহস ছিলো না আর সাঁওতাল পরগণার মাটিতে। পরের ট্রেনেই ফিরে এসেছিলাম কলকাতায়।

[25/04/18, 11:09:55 AM] Chordi Pune: Two small stories (it's important you read both) that show how the examples we set today, may help shape the character of generations tomorrow.
---------------------------------
STORY - I
We all know about Al Capone. The notorious gangster, mafia who virtually owned Chicago. He was a crime boss who lorded over the windy city dealing with all sort of crimes prostitution to murder to ...you name it...and he escaped the law for many many years. It was because of one man his -lawyer nicknamed "Easy Eddie."
Eddie was very good! In fact, Eddie's skill at legal maneuvering kept Big Al out of jail for a long time.
To show his appreciation, Capone paid him very well. Not only was the money big, but Eddie got special dividends, as well.
For instance, he and his family occupied a fenced-in mansion with live-in help and all of the conveniences of the day.. The estate was so large that it filled an entire Chicago City block.
Eddie did have one soft spot, however. He had a son that he loved dearly.
And, despite his involvement with organized crime, Eddie tried to teach him right from wrong. Eddie wanted his son to be a better man than he was. Yet, with all his wealth and influence, there were two things he couldn't give his son- he couldn't pass on a Good Name or a Good Example.
One day, Easy Eddie reached a difficult decision. It's believed Easy Eddie wanted to rectify wrongs he had done.
So he decided he would go to the authorities and tell the truth about Al "Scarface" Capone, clean up his tarnished name, and offer his son some semblance of integrity. To do this, he would have to testify against The Mob, and he knew that the cost would be great. 
Nevertheless, he testified.
Within the year, Easy Eddie's life ended in a blaze of gunfire on a lonely Chicago Street. But in his eyes, he had given his son the greatest gift he had to offer, at the greatest price he could ever pay. Police removed from his pockets a rosary, a religious symbol and medallion, and a poem clipped from a magazine.
The Poem read:
"The clock of life is wound but once, and no man has the power to tell just when the hands will stop, at late or early hour. Now is the only time you own. Live, love, toil with a will. Place no faith in time. For the clock may soon be still."
---------------------------------
STORY - II
World War II produced many heroes. One such man was Lieutenant Cdr Butch O'Hare. He was a fighter pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier Lexington in the South Pacific.
One day his entire squadron was sent on a mission. After he was airborne, he looked at his fuel gauge and realized that someone had forgotten to top off his fuel tank.
He would not have enough fuel to complete his mission and get back to his ship.
His flight leader told him to return to the carrier. Reluctantly, he dropped out of formation and headed back to the fleet.
As he was returning to the mother ship, he saw something that turned his blood cold; a squadron of Japanese aircraft was speeding its way toward the American fleet.
The American fighters were gone on a sortie, and the fleet was all but defenseless. He couldn't reach his squadron and bring them back in time to save the fleet. Nor could he warn the fleet of the approaching danger. There was only one thing to do, only thing he'd learned growing up. He must somehow divert them from the fleet.
Laying aside all thoughts of personal safety, he dove into the formation of Japanese planes. Wing-mounted 50 caliber's blazed as he charged in, attacking one surprised enemy plane and then another. Butch wove in and out of the now broken formation and fired at as many planes as possible until all his ammunition was finally spent.
Undaunted, he continued the assault. He dove at the planes, trying to clip a wing or tail in hopes of damaging as many enemy planes as possible, rendering them unfit to fly.
Finally, the exasperated Japanese squadron took off in another direction.
Deeply relieved, Butch O'Hare and his tattered fighter limped back to the carrier.
Upon arrival, he reported in and related the event surrounding his return. The film from the gun-camera mounted on his plane told the tale. It showed the extent of Butch's daring attempt to protect his fleet. He had, in fact, destroyed five enemy aircraft.
This took place on February 20, 1942 , and for that action Butch became the Navy's first Ace of W.W.II, and the first Naval Aviator to win the Medal of Honor.
A year later Butch was killed in aerial combat at the age of 29. His home town would not allow the memory of this WW II hero to fade, and today, O'Hare Airport in Chicago is named in tribute to the courage of this great man.
So, the next time you find yourself at O'Hare International, give some thought to visiting Butch's memorial displaying his statue and his Medal of Honor. It's located between Terminals 1 and 2.
---------------------------------
Uh..wait, what do these two stories have to do with each other? 

Well, you see....

Butch O'Hare was
"Easy Eddie's" son.

[26/04/18, 10:00:15 PM] Moon Pishi: HOW VERY TRUE!

My mum used to cut chicken, chop eggs and spread butter on bread on the same cutting board with the same knife and no bleach, but we didn't seem to get food poisoning.

Our school sandwiches were wrapped in wax paper in a brown paper bag, not in ice pack coolers, but I can't remember getting e.Coli

Almost all of us would have rather gone swimming in the lake or at the beach instead of a pristine pool (talk about boring), no beach closures then.

We all took PE ... And risked permanent injury with a pair of Dunlop sandshoes instead of having cross-training athletic shoes with air cushion soles and built in light reflectors that cost as much as a small car. I can't recall any injuries but they must have happened because they tell us how much safer we are now.

We got the cane for doing something wrong at school, they used to call it discipline yet we all grew up to accept the rules and to honour & respect those older than us.

We had 50 kids in our class and we all learned to read and write, do maths and spell almost all the words needed to write a grammatically correct letter... , FUNNY THAT!!

We all said prayers in school irrespective of our religion, sang the national anthem and no one got upset.

Staying in detention after school caught all sorts of negative attention we wish we hadn't got.

I thought that I was supposed to accomplish something before I was allowed to be proud of myself.

I just can't recall how bored we were without computers, Play Station, Nintendo, X-box or 270 digital TV cable stations. We weren't!!

Oh yeah ... And where was the antibiotics and sterilisation kit when I got that bee sting? I could have been killed!

We played "King of the Hill" on piles of gravel left on vacant building sites and when we got hurt, mum pulled out the 2/6p bottle of iodine and then we got our backside spanked.

Now it's a trip to the emergency room, followed by a 10 day dose of antibiotics and then mum calls the lawyer to sue the contractor for leaving a horribly vicious pile of gravel where it was such a threat.

To top it off, not a single person I knew had ever been told that they were from a dysfunctional family. How could we possibly have known that?

We never needed to get into group therapy and/or anger management classes. We were obviously so duped by so many societal ills, that we didn't even notice that the entire country wasn't taking Prozac!

How did we ever survive?

LOVE TO ALL OF US WHO SHARED THIS ERA.

AND TO ALL WHO DIDN'T, SORRY FOR WHAT YOU MISSED.

WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING!

Pass this to someone and remember that life's most simple pleasures are very often the best.

AAAAh, those WERE the days!!!!

[10/05/18, 6:04:07 PM] Moon Pishi: What makes you beautiful?

At the naughty age of 50... We had our school reunion...one of my friend mentioned - look at the girls..they are still looking so beautiful 😍...even today,I skipped a heart beat  looking at my crush ..😀. But the boys are looking so old...many are bald with protruding tummies & shrunken faces ...😔

Made me think...what makes a person beautiful? Is it just looks?

Obviously it's nice to look good...it may boost ones confidence & social interactions ...but is it enough?

I guess there is a vast difference between 'looking' beautiful  & 'being' beautiful...

A lady who has disfigured her body during pregnancy ...now she is struggling with her complexes...
..but yet she is the source of unconditional love for family ...is  beautiful...

A bald, obese man who is facing multiple professional challenges...yet he is the source of rock solid support for the family...is a beautiful person...

A working lady ...stressing herself out with balancing work & home... still finds time for her ill mother in law neglecting her taunts...is beautiful 😊

The fragrance of love & care spread by them is far superior to any strong perfume ...

Eventually the beauty of body will fade one day...but the beauty of soul will not...

Personally....how you ' look' matters for first few minutes...but how you 'are' ..matters lifetime...😊

Stay beautiful 😍

My mother just bought a new car. It is a gleaming red Nissan Micra, and she proudly drove it to the temple to get it blessed before journeying to the market and bank. Nothing exceptional about any of this—except that she is 82.
I have been pleading with her for years to get a full-time driver, but to no avail. She relishes her independence. A couple of years ago, she finally agreed to hire a driver for her frequent four-hour drives from Kochi to her tharavadu veedu (ancestral home) in Palakkad district. But for shorter trips, she prefers to be behind the wheel, not in the back seat.
She also stubbornly refuses to hire full-time domestic help. She cooks, cleans and entertains guests. Yes, a maid comes in for an hour a day to scour the dishes and mop the floors, but that’s it. Self-reliance is my mother’s mantra. She doesn’t like depending on others’ help.
My sisters live abroad. My mother lives alone. In recent years, I have begged and pleaded with her to move in with me, but she declines. She comes for a few weeks at a time and gets restless. She likes being in control, enjoys her routine and her neighbours. She regularly phones a wide circle of friends and relatives. She reads incessantly and borrows books from a circulating book club. She admits she feels lonely, but that has been the case since my father, a larger-than-life dynamo, passed away a quarter of a century ago at 63.
Her antidote to boredom is the internet. She is a tireless emailer and browser of articles, which she forwards widely. Recently, she has discovered WhatsApp and is unremitting when it comes to passing on morning greetings, trending videos, and, occasionally, ‘fake news’. In her time anything that appeared in print was reliable, and she extends the same credulity to what she reads on the internet. But offline, her scepticism is her shield.
My mother and I have not always had the easiest of relationships. What mother and son do? I know my personal and professional journeys have challenged her. And, as I know too well, she is a direct, no-nonsense woman. She can be charming if she wants, but generally does not waste time on pleasantries. When others feel the whiplash of her tongue, I shrug apologetically: “Welcome to the club.”
Growing up, I often felt that nothing I did was good enough for my mother. She had the highest expectations of me, which meant she never allowed me the luxury of self-satisfaction. She never congratulated me on my prizes or distinctions; they were expected, nothing more.
The result was that she drove me to excellence. She drove me, too, to debate and quiz competitions, to All India Radio to participate in children’s programmes, and to act in school plays. As the mother of two beautiful daughters, she pressed them to enter the Miss Calcutta contest in 1979. One sister won, the other was first runner-up. My mother expected nothing less.
My mother is multi-talented, but does not stay focused for long. She sings beautifully, but is untrained. A music director who heard her at a party once called her for an audition, but she chose an unwisely high-pitched song and, unused to the studio’s sound system, screeched herself out of a playback career. She has tried pottery and ceramics. Every visitor to my home is awestruck by a Ganesh she painted on glass in the Thanjavur style, and yet she has given up painting. I dedicated my 2001 novel, Riot, to her: “tireless seeker who taught me to value her divine discontent”.
Still, she can be determined when she has something to prove. After my father passed away, she single-handedly built a house in the Coimbatore suburbs, overcoming innumerable obstacles, and named it for her childhood home. Her point made—that she could do it—she sold it thereafter.
She disapproved of my entering politics, and prays regularly that I quit and return to what she sees as respectability. But, she has queued up to vote for me each time, and when I faced a particularly tough race in 2014, gamely climbed onto my campaign wagon to show her solidarity and support.
She goes on vacations with her septuagenarian friends, pays tribute annually to Sai Baba’s samadhi at Puttaparthi and travels widely solo. She embodies the principle that you are only as old as you allow yourself to feel.
As she confidently soldiers on in her 80s, with two titanium knees, both eyes surgically freed of cataracts, but refusing to surrender to age, I feel an admiration welling up for her that I have rarely been able to express before. I grew up thinking of my mother as critical and temperamental. But, I failed to see the steel beneath signs of her insecurity, brought on by the ill-health of an improvident husband. Her strength in coping with such an early bereavement, independence of mind and body, faith in herself and determination to face life on her own are an extraordinary lesson.
I am lucky to have a mother who sets such an amazing example. Happy Mother’s Day, Mummy.

[01/06/18, 8:40:19 AM] Moon Pishi: There are 7 puzzles which Buddha answered in his mystical way :

1) What is the SHARPEST thing in this world ?

His people replied simultaneously : *The Sword*

Buddha answered :
The sharpest is the *human tongue*
because with the tongue, humans easily hurt the heart, hurt people's feelings, through slander etc ...

2)  What is the MOST distant from us in this world ?

Some replied : *Space, the moon, the sun*

Buddha answered:
The most distant is the *Past*.
Whoever we are, however rich we may be, we can NOT go back in time.
Therefore we must make good use of today & the days that will come.

3) What is BIGGEST thing in this world ?

Someone replied :
*Mountains, the Earth .. the Sun*

Buddha answered :
*The biggest thing in the world is Lust*.

Many humans become wretched because they indulge their  lusts.
All means are justified in order to realise the lusts of this world.
Therefore be careful with lust !

4) What is the HARDEST (and has the MOST WEIGHT) in this world ?

Someone replied :
*Steel, iron .. elephant*

Buddha answered :
The hardest is ... *a promise*
It's easy to say it but extremely hard to do it.

5)  What is LIGHTEST thing in this world?

Someone replied :
*Cotton, wind, dust, leaves*

Buddha answered:
The lightest thing in the world is humility, hence it is easy *to forget humility & to leave humility*

Look at the many people who are chasing after wealth and position ..  they simply drop & leave humility.

6) What is CLOSEST to us in this world ?

Someone replied :
*Our parents, friends & relatives*

Buddha answered :
The closest to us is *DEATH*
because death is SURE and can happen any second.

7) Last question:
What's the easiest thing to do in this world ?

They replied :
*Eating, sleeping, hanging out*

Buddha answered:
The easiest is to
*SHARE THIS DHAMMA (message)*
It will be a useful reflection for your friends who read it

*Even non-Buddhists can  use this knowledge and wisdom*

May all living beings be joyful,  peaceful & wise.
🙏🙏🙏

কিন্ত রিক্সাওয়ালাকে যে ভাবে হিন্দিতে বকেছি আর কোনোদিন সে এরকম ভাবে রিক্সা চালাবে না। সেটা হলো....
ভাই রিক্সা চালাতা হ্যায় কিন্তু কোনোরকম খেয়াল নেহি রাখতা হ্যায় !!!?
একদম বোধ বুদ্ধি নেহি হ্যায় তোমারা... ছাতুর সঙ্গে দু তিনটে সেদ্ধ বা আতপ চাল মিলাকে খাও... তবে তো বুদ্ধি সুদ্দি হোগা..
রিক্সাওলার চোখটা ছল ছল করছিল।
আমি আর কিছু বললাম না... ফিরে আসছিলাম, কিন্তু ওই আমাকে দাদা বলে ডাকল আর হাত জোড় করে পরিস্কার বাংলায় বলল....
আমি কথা দিচ্ছি কোনদিন এ ভাবে রিক্সা চালাব না কিন্তু আপনি কথা দিন যে, আপনি আর হিন্দিতে কোনদিন কথা বলবেন না...

[15/06/18, 7:43:42 AM] Chordi Pune: There were three ships which were i
n the vicinity when the Titanic sunk.
One of them was known as the Sampson. It was 7 miles away from the Titanic and they saw the white flares signalling danger, but because the crew had been hunting seals illegally and didn’t want to be caught, they turned and went the opposite direction away from the sinking Titanic. 

 This ship represents us and people like us if we are so busy looking inward at our own sin and lives that we can’t recognize when someone else is in danger and in need. 

The next ship was the Californian. This ship was 14 miles away from the Titanic, but they were surrounded by ice fields and the captain looked out and saw the white flares, but because the conditions weren’t favorable and it was dark, he decided to go back to bed and wait until morning. The crew tried to convince themselves that nothing was happening. 

 This ship represents those of us who say I can’t do anything now. The conditions aren’t right for it and so we wait until conditions are perfect before going out.

The last ship was the Carpathia. This ship was actually headed in a southern direction 58 miles away from the Titanic when they heard the distress cries (SOS) over the radio. The captain of this ship knelt down, prayed to God for direction & help and then turned the ship around and went full steam ahead through the ice fields. This was the ship that saved the 705 survivors of the Titanic!!!!

When the captain looked back at the ice fields they had come through, he said: "Hands of Someone else must have been at the helm of this ship to chart this seemingly impossible course! 
Amen !!"

This ship represents those who would pray to God for direction and then go all out without hesitation.
Life whispers in your soul and speaks to your heart. We need to take time to listen and to these whispers and take heed. God is always with you!!

*Eating Fruit on Empty Stomach*

This will open your eyes ! Read to the end and then send it on to all on your e-list. I just did !

Dr Stephen Mak treats terminal ill cancer patients by an "un-orthodox" way and many patients recovered.

Before he used solar energy to clear the illnesses of his patients, he believes on natural healing in the body against illnesses. See his article below.

It is one of the strategies to heal cancer. As of late, my success rate in curing cancer is about 80%.

Cancer patients shouldn't die. The cure for cancer is already found - *its in the way we eat fruits.*

It is whether you believe it or not.

I am sorry for the hundreds of cancer patients who die under the conventional treatments.

*EATING FRUIT*

We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths.

It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and *when* to eat the fruits.

What is the correct way of eating fruits?

*IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS!*

*FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH*

If you eat fruits on empty stomach, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities. 

_FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD._

Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit.

The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so due to the bread taken before the fruit.

In the meantime the whole meal of bread & fruit rots and ferments and turns to acid. 

The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.

So please eat your fruits on an *empty stomach* *or before your meals !*

You have heard people complaining : 

Every time I eat watermelon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet, etc.. etc..

Actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on _an empty stomach._

The fruit mixes with the putrefying of other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat !

Greying hair, balding, nervous outburst and dark circles under the eyes all these will *NOT* *happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.*

There is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. 

If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the  *SECRET of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.*

When you need to drink fruit juice - *drink only  fresh fruit juice,* NOT from the cans, packs or bottles.

Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. 

Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. 

You only get its taste.
Cooking destroys all the vitamins.

But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice.

If you should drink the fresh fruit juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it. 

You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse or detoxify your body. 

Just eat fruits and drink fresh fruit juice throughout the 3 days.

And you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look !

*KIWI fruit:*
Tiny but mighty. 
This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.

*APPLE:*
An apple a day keeps the doctor away? 
Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby _helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke._ 

*STRAWBERRY:*
Protective Fruit. 
Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging and free radicals. 

*ORANGE 😗
Sweetest medicine. 
Taking 2-4 oranges a day may _help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer._

*WATERMELON:*
Coolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which _helps boost our immune system._

They are also *a key source of lycopene the cancer fighting oxidant.*
Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium. 

*GUAVA & PAPAYA:*
Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content.

Guava is also rich in fiber, which _helps prevent constipation._

Papaya is rich in carotene; this is _good for your eyes._

*Drinking COLD water or drinks after a meal = CANCER*

Can you believe this ?

For those who like to drink cold water or cold drinks, this article is applicable to you. 

It is nice to have a cup of cold water or cold drinks after a meal.

*However, the cold water or drinks will solidify the oily stuff that you have just eaten.*

*It will slow down the digestion.*

*Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food.*

*It will line the intestine.*

*Very soon, this will turn into FATS and lead to CANCER !*

_*It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.*_

Let's be careful and be aware. The more we know the better chance we could survive.

A cardiologist says: 
if everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life.

So lets do it 🍏🍓🍊🍉🍇🍍🍎🍈🍑🍒🍌

Time Bank:

Forward:

Swiss Time Bank

A student studying abroad in Switzerland observes the country in Switzerland:

While studying in Switzerland, I rented a house near the school. The landlord Kristina is a 67-year-old single old lady who worked as a teacher in a secondary school before she retired. Switzerland's pension is very rich, enough not to make her worry about eating and drinking in her later years. However, it is puzzling that she actually found a "work" - to take care of an 87-year-old single old man. I asked if she was working for money. Her answer surprised me: “I did not work for money, but I put my time in the ‘time bank’, and when I couldn’t move at old age, I could withdraw it.”
The first time I heard about the concept of "time bank", I was very curious and asked the landlord thoroughly. The original “Time Bank” was an old-age pension program developed by the Swiss Federal Ministry of Social Security. People saved the time of taking care of the elderly when they were young, and waited until they were old, ill or needed care. Applicants must be healthy, good at communicating and full of love. Every day they have plenty of time to look after the elderly who need help. Their service hours will be deposited into the personal accounts of the social security system. She went to work twice a week, spending two hours each time, to help the elderly shopping, finishing the room, taking the elderly out to sunbathe, chatting with the elderly. According to the agreement, after one year of her service expiry, “Time Bank” will count out her working hours and issue her a “time bank card”. When she needs someone to take care of her, she can use her “time bank card” to “time bank” to withdraw “time and time interest”. After the information verification is passed, “Time Bank” will assign volunteers to take care of her to the hospital or her home. .
One day, I was in school and the landlady called and said she fell off the stool when she wiped the window. I quickly took leave and sent her to the hospital for treatment. The landlady broke her ankle and needed to stay in bed for a while. While I was preparing to apply for a holiday home to take care of her, the landlady told me that I did not have to worry about her. She had already submitted a withdrawal request to the “Time Bank”. Sure enough, less than two hours, "Time Bank" sent a nursing worker to come to care for the landlord. In the following month, the care worker took care of the landlord every day, chatted with her and made delicious meals for her. Under the meticulous care of the carer, the landlady soon recovered to health. After recovering, the landlady went back to "work".  She said that she intends to save time in the "time bank" when she is still healthy, and wait until she can't move.
Today, in Switzerland, the use of "time banks" to support old age has become a common practice. This not only saves the country pension expenses, but also solves some other social problems. Many Swiss citizens are very supportive of this kind of old-age pensions. The survey conducted by the Swiss pension organization shows that more than half of Swiss young people also want to participate in this type of old-age care service. The Swiss government also specializes in legislation to support the "Time Bank" pension.
At present, the number of "empty-nest old people" in China is continuously increasing and it has gradually become a social problem. Switzerland's use of "time bank" pension may be a good reference for us.

[21/06/18, 9:25:30 PM] Chordi Pune: That was what came to my mind immediately as I received this forward...about You! Only the concept of time bank is new. You do it without any expectation...perhaps it's  a 'karmic' investment😊

[25/06/18, 8:29:29 AM] Chordi Pune: When a newspaper reporter interviewed a farmer who grew Award-Winning Maize each year he entered his maize in the Agricultural Show, it was revealed that the farmer shared his seed with his neighbours.
Amazed, the reporter asked, “How can you afford to share your best seed with your neighbours when they are entering their maize in competition with yours each year?”
The farmer smiled knowingly and explained, *“The wind picks up pollen from the ripening maize and swirls it from field to field.* If my neighbours grow inferior maize, Cross-Pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my maize.
If I am to grow good maize, I must help my neighbours grow a good crop.
So it is with our lives. Those who want to live meaningfully and well, must help enrich the lives of others.
For the value of a life, is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy, must help others find happiness.
For the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.
Call it power of collectivity.
Call it a principle of success. Call it a law of life.
The fact remains, “None of us truly wins, until we all win.”
Know this secret as you grow older!
In life, when you help the people around you to be good, you surely become the best.

[24/07/18, 8:46:46 PM] Mama: In Mahabharat, Karna asks Lord Krishna - "My mother left me the moment I was born. Is it my fault I was born an illegitimate child?

I did not get the education from Dhronacharya because I was considered not a Kshatriya.

Parshu-Raam taught me but then gave me the curse to forget everything when he came to know I was  Son of Kunthi belong to Kshatriya.

A cow was accidentally hit by my arrow & its owner cursed me for no fault of mine.

I was disgraced in Draupadi's Swayamvar.

Even Kunthi finally told me the truth only to save her other sons.

Whatever I received was through Duryodhana's charity.

So how am I wrong in taking his side ???"

**Lord Krishna replies, "Karna, I was born in a jail.

Death was waiting for me even before my birth.

The night I was born I was separated from my birth parents.

From childhood, you grew up hearing the noise of swords, chariots, horses, bow, and arrows. I got only cow herd's shed, dung, and multiple attempts on my life even before I could walk!

No Army, No Education. I could hear people saying I am the reason for all their problems.

When all of you were being appreciated for your valour by your teachers I had not even received any education. I joined Gurukula of Rishi Sandipani only at the age of 16!

You are married to a girl of your choice. I didn't get the girl I loved & rather ended up marrying those who wanted me or the ones I rescued from demons.

I had to move my whole community from the banks of Yamuna to far off Sea shore to save them from Jarasandh. I was called a coward for running away!!

If Duryodhana wins the war you will get a lot of credit. What do I get if Dharmaraja wins the war? Only the blame for the war and all related problems...

Remember one thing, Karna. Everybody has Challenges in life to face.

LIFE IS NOT FAIR & EASY ON ANYBODY!!!

But what is Right (Dharma) is known to your Mind (conscience). No matter how much unfairness we got, how many times we were Disgraced, how many times we Fall, what is important is how you REACTED at that time.

Life's unfairness does not give you license to walk the wrong path...

Always remember, Life may be tough at few pointsC, but DESTINY is not created by the SHOES we wear but by the STEPS we take...

[04/09/18, 2:19:35 PM] Laila Jethima: *THE STRANGER I GREW UP WITH !!!*                                           

A few years after I was born, my Dad met a stranger who was new to our small town. From the  beginning, Dad was fascinated with this  enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live  with our family.  The stranger was quickly  accepted and was around from then on.  
As  I grew up, I never questioned his place in my  family. In my young mind, he had a special  niche. My parents were complementary  instructors: Mum taught me good from evil, and  Dad taught me to obey. But the stranger... he  was our storyteller. He would keep us spellbound for hours on end with adventures, mysteries and  comedies.  
  
If  I wanted to know anything about politics, history or science, he always knew the answers  about the past, understood the present and even  seemed able to predict the future!  He took  my family to the first premiership game.  He made me laugh, and he made me  cry. The stranger never stopped talking, but Dad  didn't seem to mind.  
 
Sometimes, Mum  would get up quietly while the rest of us were  shushing each other to listen to what he had to  say, and she would go to the kitchen for peace  and quiet.  
(I  wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger  to leave.)  
 
Dad ruled our household with  certain moral convictions, but the stranger  never felt obligated to honor them.   Profanity, for example, was not allowed in our  home - not from us, our friends or any  visitors  Our long time visitor, however,  got away with four-letter words that burned my  ears and made my dad squirm and my mother  blush.  My Dad didn't permit the liberal  use of alcohol but the stranger encouraged us to  try it on a regular basis.  He made  cigarettes look cool, cigars manly, and pipes  distinguished. He talked freely (much too  freely!) about sex.  His comments were  sometimes blatant, sometimes suggestive, and  generally embarrassing. 
 
I now know that  my early concepts about relationships were  influenced strongly by the stranger. Time after  time, he opposed the values of my parents, yet  he was seldom rebuked... And NEVER asked to  leave.  
 
More than fifty years have passed  since the stranger moved in with our family. He  has blended right in and is not nearly as  fascinating as he was at first. Still, if you  could walk into my parents' den today, you would  still find him sitting over in his corner,  waiting for someone to listen to him talk and  watch him draw his pictures.    
     
 
His  name?....
 
We  just call him 'TV.' 
 
(Note:  This should be required reading for every  household!)   
He  has a wife now....we call her  'Computer.'
Their  first child is "Cell Phone".
Second  child "video games"
By the way, they now have a wonderful grand child
she is a genius!
she is fondly called "Whatsup"..
She is nearly more popular than  her mom 
her older cousin is "Facebook" and new baby cousins  are "Snapchat, Instagram"

*This Stranger and members of its family appear to have taken up permanent residence in our homes and we seem powerless to check their excesses!!*

[10/09/18, 11:48:05 AM] Chordi Pune: *HOMING IN …*

We don’t live in bungalows, duplexes or flats. We live in our minds.……….

Yes, that’s our permanent residence. And there are no constraints of square-feet there. It’s a vast space with unlimited area. And you know what! No matter how well-organized your rooms, balconies, garages and verandas are, life is good only when things are sorted there – in your mind.

And that’s where we keep things messy – regrets piling up in one corner, expectations stuffed in a closet, secrets under the carpet, worries littered everywhere, comparisons spilt on the table, complexes leaking from an old bottle, and grudges stinking in a box.

*MIND IT!*
*For this ‘real home’ of yours, you can’t outsource housekeeping.*
*YOU GOT TO DO IT YOURSELF.*

[12/09/18, 11:16:36 AM] Chordi Pune: When we think of love, we usually focus on how much others are loving us. But the most important source of love you need is from yourself. You may read this and think, "I love myself. I do good things for myself. I'm proud of my accomplishments." However most people love themselves conditionally-IF they achieve their goals, IF they are the perfect weight or look a certain way, IF they're in the perfect relationship, IF things in their life are going well. It's more difficult to feel good about yourself when you're frightened or insecure, when you're facing challenges, or when the people in your life are in crisis. 
Loving yourself means loving yourself as you are. It means accepting yourself during good times and bad, in terrible moments and triumphant moments. It means honoring yourself for how hard you've been working on yourself, the obstacles you have bravely overcome, and for the progress you HAVE made. 
Love yourself for every step you are taking now and have taken in the past. 
Love yourself when you fall down, and love yourself when you pick yourself back up again. ....

[14/09/18, 6:32:25 PM] Papa: Karl Marx said this on religion. ... “Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.”

[06/10/18, 10:56:29 AM] Papa: Hi, I watched this movie A Beautiful Mind and then got a bit interested to study more on John Forbes Nash, a mathematician to receive Nobel prize initially for work in Economics (still used now) and later for nonlinear partial differential equations. He also went through difficult times including years in a mental hospital. The movie ending is wonderful - maths is about numbers, which gives us reasons. What’s beyond reasons? If possible, see the movie.

ভক্তি ও শাস্ত্রবিধির বিরোধে শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণদেব মথুরকে যা বলেছিলেন, বিসর্জনের তাৎপর্যার্থে তা স্মরণীয়। মথুর শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণদেবকে যখন জানালেন- তিনি প্রাণ থাকতে দেবী দুর্গা মাকে বিসর্জন দিতে পারবেন না, তখন শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণদেব হেসে তাঁকে বলেন: "ওঃ! এই তোমার ভয়? তা মাকে ছেড়ে তোমায় থাকতে হবে কে বললে? আর বিসর্জন দিলেই বা তিনি যাবেন কোথায়? ছেলেকে ছেড়ে মা কি কখন থাকতে পারে? এ তিন দিন বাইরে দালানে বসে তোমার পূজা নিয়েছেন, আজ থেকে তোমার আরও নিকটে থেকে- সর্বদা তোমার হৃদয়ে বসে তোমার পূজা নেবেন। মাকে বিসর্জন দেবে কোথায়? বিসর্জন দেবে নিজের হৃদয়ে।"

শুভ বিজয়া।

বড়দের প্রণাম, ছোটদের ভালোবাসা ও আদর, আর সমবয়স্কদের শুভেচ্ছা ও অভিনন্দন জানাই।

[22/10/18, 12:11:23 PM] Chordi Pune: *আমরা এক একজন এক এক প্রান্তে থাকি। সুখে দুঃখে পাশে এসে দাঁড়াই। ঝগড়া হয়। মনোমালিন্য হয়।  চোখের জলে, অভিমানে কয়েক দশকের বসন্ত পার হয়। কিন্তু ভালোবাসাটুকু রয়ে যায় চিলেকোঠার ঘরে ॥*

*এখন এক অদ্ভুত সময়ের মধ্যে দিয়ে আমরা চলেছি। একদিকে নতুন প্রজন্ম ধীরে ধীরে শাখা প্রশাখা বিস্তার করছে, অন্যদিকে বিগত প্রজন্মের এক একটি অধ্যায় সমাপ্তির পথে। দেওয়ালের পরিসর ক্রমে ক্রমে ছোটো হচ্ছে প্রিয়জনের ফটোফ্রেমে ॥*

*হারিয়ে যাচ্ছে সেই সব মানুষেরা যাদের বকুনি শোনার জন্যই মন চাইতো আরো দুষ্টুমি করতে। উৎসবের দিনগুলোয় যাদের ভালোবাসা, আগলে রাখা - আমাদের আবদার আরো  বাড়িয়ে দিতো।দিনের শেষে যাদের ভয়ে অষ্টমীর রাতে তাড়াতাড়ি বাড়ি ফিরতাম। আবার পরদিন সকালেই তাদের হাতে 'নতুন ক্যাপ বন্দুক' দেখে ভুলে যেতাম নতুন জামার আনন্দ। সেই মানুষগুলো একে একে বিদায় নিচ্ছে এই রঙ্গমঞ্চ থেকে। যেন উত্তরসূরীদের হাতে তুলে দিয়ে যাচ্ছে নাটকের পরবর্তী অংকের গুরুদায়িত্ব ॥* 

*আমরা সকলেই সাধারণ, কিন্তু পরিবারের সদস্যদের মধ্যে খুঁজে পাই সেই অসাধারণ মানুষগুলোকে যারা সামনে থাকলে মনে হয় 'না! আর কোনো চিন্তা নেই, সব ঠিক হয়ে যাবে'॥*

*আকাশের দিকে তাকিয়ে ছোটরা যখন জিজ্ঞেস করে "ওই দাদুটা ষ্টার হয়ে গেছে তাই না?" - বুঝে পাই না কি উত্তর দেব ॥* 

*যদি তাই হয়, তাহলে কালো আকাশে যখন তারা খসে, সেই 'দাদু' বা 'দিদুন' রা কি ফিরে আসে কোনো নতুন রূপে সেই উত্তর আজও খুঁজে বেড়াই ॥*

*বছর ঘুরে ফিরে আসে বিজয়া দশমীর বিকেল, কিন্তু ধীরে ধীরে হারিয়ে যাচ্ছে পায়ের সংখ্যা। প্রণামের ইচ্ছে মনের মধ্যেই রয়ে যায়, স্নেহাশীষ রয়ে যায় আকাশের বুকে। তোমরা ভালো থেকো। তাহলেই আমরা ভালো থাকবো ॥*

*শুভ বিজয়ার অনেক অনেক প্রীতি ও শুভেচ্ছা  ॥*
[24/10/18, 4:28:01 PM] Chordi Pune: প্ৰশ্ন: লক্ষ্মী পূজো রাতে কিন্তু সরস্বতী পূজো দিনে কেন করা হয় ?
উত্তর : এই ব্যবস্থা করা হয়েছে দুই দেবীর Driver দের সুবিধের জন্য। লক্ষ্মীর Driver পেঁচা, উনি দিনে drive করতে পারেন না, অপরদিকে সরস্বতীর driver হলেন হাঁস, তিনি আবার দিনেই শুধু drive করতে পারেন, সন্ধ্যে হলে তিনি আর service দিতে  পারেন না। তাই, লক্ষ্মী পূজো রাতে আর সরস্বতী পূজা দিনে  করার বিধান । ☝😇

------------------

নিম পাতাতে ঔষধি গুন
তুলসী পাতায় সুখ,
পান পাতাতে বিয়ের কনে
লজ্জায় ঢাকে মুখ।

ডাল ফোঁড়নে কারি পাতা 
চাটনি ধনে পাতায়,
তেজ পাতাতে নাইরে তেজ
কিইবা আসে যায়।

বেল পাতাতে হয়রে পূজো
তালপাতাতে বাঁশী,
কলাপাতায় ইলিশ পাতুরী
খেতে যে ভালবাসি।

লাউয়ের পাতা, পালং পাতা
মূলার পাতা হলে,
পাতার পরিচয় যায়রে ঘুচে
শাকই সবাই বলে।

খাতার পাতায় যায়রে লেখা
চোখের পাতায় ঘুম,
মনের পাতায় অনেক স্মৃতি
থাকলো নাহয় গুম্।

হাত পাতায় লজ্জা ভীষণ
কান পাতায় দোষ,
হাঁড়ি পাতা দৈয়ের স্বাদ
খেলেই বলে জোশ্।

কাঁঠাল পাতা পেলে ছাগল
চিবায় মনের সুখে,
তামাক পাতা পেলে মানুষ
ধোঁয়া ছাড়ে মুখে!

বিছুটি পাতা ঘষলে গায়ে
বোবাও কথা বলে,
আড়ি পাতা দোষের কাজ
দেখলেই গা জ্বলে।

জীবন পাতার সবুজ রঙ 
সময়ে হয় ফিকে,
শুকিয়ে গেলে যাবে ঝরে
কেউ রবেনা টিকে।

ফাঁদ পাতা এই দুনিয়াতে
সবাই ধরা পড়ে,
কচু পাতায় জলের মতো
জীবন নড়ে চড়ে।
--------------------------------
মনের পাতায় লিখে রাখলাম 
              নানান পাতার পদ্য;
অতি সুন্দর ' পাতা সমাচার '

[30/10/18, 8:57:04 PM] Papa: Hey, there is a point. Normally this is true. Manna Dey died in 90s. But some of the greatest male singers Kishore, Rafi, Mukesh or even Jackson all died in 50s. 
I remember seeing a report that says that people who lived long all had high level of social interaction. In reverse, loneliness typically results in depression.
[31/10/18, 5:55:36 AM] Chordi Pune: Social interaction is undeniably an important aspect  of a long healthy life, while music improves the quality of our life...

[31/10/18, 7:10:50 AM] Papa: If you do what you want to do, be it music, job, cooking, satsang or even whattsapping, and that there is positive emotion like social appreciation, then surely longevity, performance and all will improve. But that’s not easy. SD Burman probably had better conditions, lived good till 69. RD died in 54. But RD’s best tunes were when he was staying alone in Khar hotel between time after first marriage divorce and before marriage with Asha. So I would say stress is the killer.

1. At a movie theatre, which arm rest is yours? 

2. In the word scent, is "S"  silent or "C"? 

3. If people evolve from monkeys, why are monkeys still around? 

4. Why is there a 'D' in fridge, 

but not in refrigerator? 

5. Who knew what time it was when the first clock was made?

And now sixer ....

 6. If pro and con are opposites, wouldn't the opposite of progress be...congress?

Vagaries of English Language! Enjoy!!!😀😀😀

- Wonder why the word funeral starts with FUN?

-Why isn't a Fireman called a Water-man?

- How come Lipstick doesn't do what it says?

- If money doesn't grow on trees, how come Banks have Branches? 

- If a Vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a Humanitarian eat?

- How do you get off a non-stop Flight?

- Why are goods sent by ship called CARGO and those sent by truck SHIPMENT?

- Why do we put cups in the dishwasher and the dishes in the Cupboard?

- Why do doctors 'practice' medicine? Are they having practice at the cost of the patients? 

- Why is it called 'Rush Hour' when traffic moves at its slowest then?

- How come Noses run and Feet smell? 

- Why do they call it a TV 'set' when there is only one?

- What are you  vacating when you go on a vacation?

We can never find the answers, can we?

So just enjoy the pun and fun of the English language!!

[28/11/18, 8:04:46 PM] Moon Pishi: In the United States, an estimated 5.4 million people have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This figure is growing rapidly with the ageing population.

One of them was Steve Newport. His wife, Mary Newport, was a doctor. Dr. Mary learned that her husband had severe Alzheimer's disease.

When the doctor examined her husband at the hospital, he asked Steve to paint a clock. Instead, he drew a few circles and then drew a few figures without any logic. It was not like a clock at all!.

The doctor pulled her aside and said: "Your husband is already on the verge of severe Alzheimer's disease!"

It turned out that it was a test of whether a person had Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Mary was very upset at that time, but as a doctor, she would not just give up. She began to study the disease. She found out Alzheimers disease was associated to glucose deficiency to the brain.

Her research says: "The dementia of the elderly is like having diabetes in the head ! Before one has the symptoms of Diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, the body has already had problems for 10 to 20 years."

According to Dr. Mary's study, Alzheimer's disease is very similar to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The cause is also insulin imbalance.

Because insulin has a problem, it prevents the brain cells from absorbing glucose. Glucose is the nutrition of brain cells. Without glucose, brain cells die.

As it turns out, these high-quality proteins are the cells that feed our body.

But nutrition for our brain cell is glucose. As long as we have mastered the source of these two kinds of food, we are the masters of our own health!

The next question is, where to find glucose? It cannot be the ready-made glucose that we buy from the store. It is not from fruits such as grapes. She started looking for alternatives.

The alternative nutrients for brain cells are ketones. Ketones are necessary in brain cells. Ketones cannot be found in vitamins. 

*Coconut oil* contains triglicerides. After the triglycerides in *coconut oil* is consumed, it is metabolised into ketones in the liver. This is the alternative nutrient for brain cells!

After this scientific verification, Dr. Mary added *coconut oil* to her husband's food. After only two weeks, when he went to the hospital again to do painting and clock tests, the progress was amazing.

Dr. Mary said: "At that time, I thought, has God heard my prayers? Wouldn't it be coconut oil that worked ? But there is no other way.Anyway, it's better to continue taking the*coconut oil*."

Dr. Mary was now part of the traditional medical practice base. She clearly knew the capabilities of traditional medicine. 

Three weeks later, the third time she took him to do a smart clock test, the performance was better than the last time. This progress was not only intellectual, but also emotional and physical.

Dr. Mary said: "He could not do his running but now he can run. He could not read for a year and a half, but he can read again now after taking *coconut oil* for three months."

Her husband's actions had already begun to change. He did not speak in the mornings. Now she noticed a lot of changes: "Now after he gets up, he is spirited, talking and laughing. He drinks water himself and take utensils for himself on his own."

On the surface, these are very simple daily tasks, but only those who have come to the clinic or have demented relatives at home can experience the joy: It is not easy to see such progress!

After frying the greens & onions in coconut oil, making cakes with coconut, after taking 3 to 4 tablespoons of coconut oil per meal, 2-3 months later, the eyes too can now focus normally.

Her studies proved that *coconut oil* can really improve the problem of dementia in the elderly.

Apply *coconut oil* to bread. When coconut cream is used, the taste is unexpectedly good.

Young people can also use it for maintenance of health and prevention, and can improve if they have symptoms of dementia.

Dementia is caused because nutrients cannot be transported to brain cells, and nutrients must be passed from the body to the brain by insulin.

Especially for diabetic patients its not easy to get insulin secretion. “Nutrition cannot get to the brain. When brain cells are starved to death, they are deprived of intelligence.”

*Coconut oil* contains medium-chain triglyceride, which can supply nutrients to the brain without using insulin. 
*So, it can improve Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease*.

After reading the article, don't forget to share it.
[28/11/18, 8:09:35 PM] Laila Jethima: We just read an article put up at a fortis hospital saying coconut oil is high in saturated fats and hence very bad for the heart.what to believe it's very confident.none of these articles are medically proven

[01/12/18, 6:36:08 PM] Papa: Partho, thanks for sharing this. Not only true as a parent to child, but all relationships like one adult to another adult and all interactions. The conflict arises when for survival you also have to fight and only the fittest survives.
[02/12/18, 3:43:39 PM] Chordi Pune: True in all relationships...but kids are the worst affected. 

Aren't all of us guilty?

[21/12/18, 12:13:07 PM] Chordi Pune: *Today, December 21,* marks the Winter solstice the first day of winter in the northern hemisphere — the shortest day and the longest night of the year. It happens once a year in every hemisphere and perhaps the reason why this day is so unique.

This is the day when Sun appears at its most southern position.  The solstice this year is also special because it will be followed the next day by a full moon, called the Cold Moon, which will be visible in the night with the Ursid meteor shower. Here’s all you need to know about the Winter solstice, how long is it, and its relevance.

*What does solstice mean?*
The term ‘solstice’ is derived from two Latin words “sol” which means sun, and “sistere”, meaning standstill. The Sun seems to stand still in the winter sky, marking the shortest day and longest night of the year.

*What is the Winter solstice?*
The Winter solstice 2018 will mark the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere, which the sun appears at its most southern position, directly overhead along the Tropic of Cancer. It also marks the longest day of the year in the Southern hemisphere. It will come with a full moon in the sky. The full moon will be visible between December 21 and December 22.

Salt -VS- Rice...

If you were to cook 3 cups of rice, would you add 3 cups of salt to it?

Certainly not!

So, in every preparation of rice, the rice always outnumbers the salt, yet a little salt makes a huge difference/impact in the overall outcome.

In the room in which you currently are, look up at the ceiling... 
What is the size of the bulb compared to the size of the room? It is probably a ratio of 1:5000.
Yet, darkness flees the entire space once the small bulb is flipped on.

If I am the salt of the earth, and the light of the world, then "little me" has the ability to make big things happen..

Sometimes, because we feel outnumbered or overwhelmed at the sheer magnitude of evil or wrong-doers, we then choose powerlessness, and decide to go with the flow, not standing up for what we believe is right.

Little doesn't mean insignificant.
You are significant. Your presence should make a BIG difference. Stop waiting to be on the side of the majority. They may be the majority, but they are the trivial majority, and you are the impactful minority.

They are the rice of the world, and you are the salt of the world..
They are the room and you are the light.
Make your influence felt!

Remember:
You are the world's seasoning, to make it beautiful...

[22/01/19, 11:33:27 AM] Chordi Pune: *Settle Down?!?*

*The whole concept of 'settling down' is misleading. We think we will settle down after finishing our studies (seriously?) maybe after marriage (nope), then we think we might settle down after being successful (doesn't happen), certainly after having kids(do we?), ok after the kids grow up, (absolutely not).* 
*Life is not meant to settle down, life is meant to struggle, to explore, to wander. to love, to lose, to learn, to unlearn, to fail, to rebel, to live.*

*Even our ashes don‘t settle, they fly away in all directions."*

[25/01/19, 11:13:28 PM] Moon Pishi: This still image was created by a Japanese neurology professor Yamamoto, and he told the instructions below:

1. If its not moving, or just moved a little, and stopped when you focused, you are healthy and has slept well.

2. If it is moving slowly, you are a bit stressed or tired.

3. If it is moving continuously, you are over-stressed and might have mental problems.

[28/01/19, 7:15:07 PM] Moon Pishi: Lesson from Hindu scriptures... 

1. Ravana sent his sister Shoorpanakha to defeat  Ram

2. Kamsa sent his sister Pootani to kill Krishna

3. Hiranyakashipu sent his sister Holika to kill Pralhad

And we all know what happenened in the end........

I am just quoting Hindu scriptures,  if it has any resemblance to any political  leader roping in his sister in Indian politics,  it is not deliberate or intentional..👻

[03/02/19, 4:23:22 PM] Papa: To whom is this message aimed at?
[03/02/19, 4:32:25 PM] Papa: Yes, someone told me 3 decades back to improve also on education and not just qualifications
[03/02/19, 4:38:36 PM] Papa: For sure, this is true, but I think among humans it is difficult. I think with animals, it may be ok. I watched a movie Marley & Me. It’s about a dog. End says - “A dog doesn't care if you're rich or poor, educated or illiterate, clever or dull. Give him your heart and he will give you his.”

[09/02/19, 12:52:32 PM] Papa: Thanks for this. I longed to see Michael Flatley’s Riverdance shows, but I remember it was too expensive even in the early 90s. I was told that it is just a mesmerising experience to see this live.
[09/02/19, 12:57:15 PM] Papa: Thanks for this. Clear message from him - talk (or for many social networking) less, and walk or run more. Not that I fully agree, may be we need both.
[09/02/19, 1:39:01 PM] Moon Pishi: I agree.
[09/02/19, 1:54:48 PM] Papa: Nowadays everyone reads only what is received as forwarded. So
[09/02/19, 1:56:20 PM] Papa: looked at what makes a great nation or civilisation. And found this quote by John Ruskin that talks of books.
[09/02/19, 1:56:56 PM] Papa: Quote - Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts—the book of their deeds, the book of their words, and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others; but of the three, the only quite trustworthy one is the last. The acts of a nation may be triumphant by its good fortune; and its words mighty by the genius of a few of its children: but its art, only by the general gifts and common sympathies of the race.
[09/02/19, 1:59:28 PM] Papa: My thoughts - digitalisation can make things more efficient, but at some stage we need to go back to arts and reading to continue being a great civilisation
[09/02/19, 3:03:37 PM] Papa: The book also says that only those civilisations survived when man has shown himself to be an intelligent, creative, orderly and compassionate animal.
I just thought of our people, especially our leaders.

[11/02/19, 8:00:28 PM] Partho Jethu: Simple. Bcoz they did not. We did.
[11/02/19, 8:11:32 PM] Papa: Wonder why we don’t offer the Devi salads.
[11/02/19, 8:27:08 PM] Partho Jethu: Someone said that if the Devis actually consumed our offerings only batasha or nakuldana would be offered

[11/02/19, 10:37:23 PM] Papa: I see a bit of discrimination towards men. Ganesha gets only Modak made from coconut and jaggery, his father Shiva gets only milk and water, whereas the sisters and mom Parvathi get all the mouthwatering stuff. Bit unfair.
Even Krishna was okay with a single dana of rice.
[11/02/19, 11:54:00 PM] Chordi Pune: My Saraswati and Lakshmi are very fond of khichuri, and luchi(unhealthy stuff)besides gurer payesh and chomchom and also fruits!!😟 
Even their holy mother relishes these!
 It's a woman's world...😁
others can do with fruits and milk and a grain of rice😄

[24/02/19, 10:55:39 AM] Papa: In line with what the court said, the below is from TOI today and are not my views
[24/02/19, 10:55:44 AM] Papa: BENGALURU: Addressing a rapt crowd on a crisp Saturday morning, author Devdutt Pattanaik began with a self-deprecating comment. "I was dreading today that there wouldn't be an audience!" he quipped during the course of his keynote address at the fifth edition of Times Litfest that kicked off at the Jayamahal Palace here in Bengaluru. That was the writer's bid to explain the essence of his talk which was based on the festival theme, Astitva: Our Collective Being. Pattanaik held forth on the meaning of Astitva in his inimitable style.
[24/02/19, 10:56:18 AM] Papa: "An individual's astitva or existence is related to gaining attention," Pattanaik said. "Can existence happen without a witness? If nobody sees you, or hears you, do you exist? Everyone wants to be seen and heard and acknowledged." That is the reason why, he noted, "we have Instagram and Facebook. This need to be acknowledged is the reason why you get depressed when you don't get the likes," he joked.

[25/02/19, 7:05:01 AM] Mama: 👍
[25/02/19, 7:59:05 AM] Chordi Pune: Couldn't agree with this completely.  As far as i understand seeking attention comes from a need...some may suffer from that for various reasons while others may shy away from it. We have a collective existence, but each is on his or her own journey as an individual (if karmic philosophy were to be believed). Love and acceptance seem to be the only way to remain in harmony while having the strength to protect oneself from harm.
[25/02/19, 8:02:17 AM] Chordi Pune: A writer needs his/her readers,  an actor needs an audience....because they are communicating with people. These cannot be compared to trivial things like 'likes' on facebook or Instagram.
[25/02/19, 8:04:06 AM] Chordi Pune: Of course one may exist even if no one sees or hears one. That's a choice.
[25/02/19, 9:52:55 AM] Chordi Pune: Existence is beyond sense perceptions,  isn't it? 
Perhaps Pattanaik needs to re-evaluate his thoughts and knowledge.

[28/02/19, 10:05:29 PM] Moon Pishi: Poem written by Adhiti- Abhinandan’s sister 👇🏻👇🏻

My Brother With a Bloodied Nose

My brother with a bloodied nose,
And officer and gentleman.
Landed across the Line of Control today.
Ejecting after doing the best he can.

They caught him on their land and then,
Thrashed him like perhaps any of us would.
Till the army stepped in and dispersed them.
And rescued him while they could.

They asked him who he was and he said,
With poise and utmost grace.
A flying pilot of the Indian Air Force.
Battered, bruised, but with a proud face.

If only the general public could,
Muster a milligram of the same poise.
And realize that their war drum beating.
Is a ridiculous dangerous noise.

My brother with a bloodied nose,
He stood there firm and tall.
And smiled in the face of his captors.
And taught us the biggest lesson of them all.

That bravery is not ordered online,
Does not ship overnight on Amazon Prime.
Tis not the moment of jingoism and memes.
For armchair aggro tis not the time.

My brother with a bloodied nose,
Thank you for your dedication and verve.
Your class and bravery I fear though,
Is a little more than some of us deserve.

For those whose fury takes wing today,
Who have no idea what it's like.
To parachute into enemy territory,
Taking a hit in a combat strike.

My brother with a bloodied nose,
You've taught a lesson to us all.
You can bail out of an aircraft at high speed,
And yet to lows never fall.

And keep your cheer and character in times,
Of uncertainty in the face of death.
And learn again to behave as human beings,
If we only would our conscience let.

My brother with a bloodied nose. 
Keep you chin up, enjoy the brew.
A salute to your sacrifice today and forever.
Hold on a while, we're coming to get you.

My brother With a bloodied nose.
The bison who took on the sun.
Here's to you and all those that stand guard for us.
Nabah Sparsam Diptam.

Salute 🙏🏽

Will you please post this message in the known groups so that it gets circulated, thanks.

```Soon the season of fruits like mango, jamun, jack fruit Etc will come. My request to all of us is kindly don't throw the seeds, wash them and pack n  keep it in  in ur car. Whenever you go out and find baren land while  travelling, on a highway throw these seeds. They will germinate easily the coming monsoon. If with this act we can contribute even a single tree each to our world, our mission is successful. This is not just a random idea. It was initiated decades ago in areas like satara and ratnagiri in maharastra. Many other districts have appealed to people to spread abundance in nature this way and many citizens   have joined this wonderful mission. It wud b wonderful if all of us also join this and contribute back to our next generations world.```

Pl forward to all groups.... (All tree on earth )

[06/06/19, 9:39:49 PM] Moon Pishi: *WHEN BODY PARTS ARE USED AS VERBS*
            
Many parts of the body can be used as verbs in either a physical or a metaphorical sense. 

You can *head* a company, but if things go wrong you'll have to *shoulder* the blame, or *face* your investors. 
A good leader will *back* his employees, but if you don't *toe* the line the management can *skin* you.
Did you *muscle* your way into that job? 
You might *eye* someone suspiciously, or wait for the police to *finger* a suspect. 
But if you need to get out of town, you can *thumb* a ride or you can ride with me if you can *stomach* the thought.
Use strong *arm* tactic if you want to *elbow* out someone.
I don't always sing along with the radio, but I sometimes do *mouth* the words.

That's Amazing English! (To all English-Language Lovers)

You can also share it with other members who follow you. Instead of posting pictures of water scarcity, let's post pictures of rain, rivers, children playing in water, falls and oceans brimming. If the universe responds to our positive thoughts we will have abundant rain this year. 
*Being overwhelmed with this positive idea and thought, here I am, starting this chain of positivity with a beautiful water pic!*

good fun , Partho.
[29/08/19, 11:03:55 AM] Chordi Pune: We've already added 45. The question  is how many more now... 
after tbe addition. No?

Messing with you😘 
I still need to understand the calculation 😂
[29/08/19, 11:13:36 AM] Partho Jethu: So if you take 45 cubes as already added you need 91 cubes more.
6x6 in one dimension
6x5 in second dimension
5x5 in third dimension
So 36+30+25=91

It is said that before entering the sea a river trembles with fear.

She looks back at the path she has traveled, from the peaks of the mountains, the long winding road crossing forests and villages.

And in front of her, she sees an ocean so vast, that to enter there seems nothing more than to disappear forever.

But there is no other way.
The river can not go back.

Nobody can go back.
To go back is impossible in existence.

The river needs to take the risk of entering the ocean because only then will fear disappear, because that's where the river will know it's not about disappearing into the ocean, but of becoming the ocean.

[28/09/19, 5:33:22 PM] Moon Pishi: *Chappaties will soon become EXTINCT*

A renowned cardiologist explains how eliminating wheat can IMPROVE your health.

Cardiologist William Davis, MD, started his career repairing damaged hearts through angioplasty and bypass surgeries.

“That’s what I was trained to do, and at first, that’s what I wanted to do,” he explains. But when his own mother died of a heart attack in 1995, despite receiving the best cardiac care, he was forced to face nagging concerns about his profession.

"I’d fix a patient’s heart, only to see him come back with the same problems. It was just a band-aid, with no effort to identify the *cause* of the disease.”

So he moved his practice toward highly uncharted medical territory 
– prevention – and spent the next 15 years examining the causes of heart disease in his patients.

The resulting discoveries are revealed in 
"Wheat Belly", his New York Times best-selling book, which attributes many of our physical problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity, to our consumption of wheat.
Eliminating wheat can “transform our lives.”

*What is a “Wheat Belly”?*
Wheat  raises your blood sugar dramatically. In fact, two slices of wheat bread raise your blood sugar more than a Snickers bar. 

"When my patients give up wheat,  weight loss was substantial, especially from the abdomen. People can lose several inches in the first month."
You make connections between wheat and a host of other health problems. 

Eighty percent of my patients had diabetes or pre-diabetes. 

I knew that wheat spiked blood sugar more than almost anything else, so I said,  “Let’s remove wheat from your diet and see what happens to your blood sugar.” They’d come back 3 to 6 months later, and their blood sugar would be dramatically reduced.
But they also had all these other reactions: 
“I removed wheat and I lost 38 pounds.” Or, “my asthma got so much better, I threw away two of my inhalers.” 
Or “the migraine headaches I’ve had every day for 20 years stopped within three days.” “My acid reflux is now gone.” 
“My IBS is better, my ulcerative colitis, my rheumatoid arthritis, my mood, my sleep . . .” and so on, and so on".

When you look at the makeup of wheat, Amylopectin A, a chemical unique to wheat, is an incredible trigger of small LDL particles in the blood – the number one cause of heart disease.

When wheat is removed from the diet, these small LDL levels plummet by 80 and 90 percent.

Wheat contains high levels of Gliadin, a protein that actually stimulates appetite. Eating wheat increases the average person’s calorie intake by 400 calories a day.     

Gliadin also has opiate-like properties which makes it "addictive".
Food scientists have known this for almost 20 years.

Is eating a wheat-free diet the same as a gluten-free diet? 
Gluten is just one component of wheat. 
If we took the gluten out of it, wheat will still be bad since it will still have the Gliadin and the Amylopectin A, as well as several other undesirable components.

Gluten-free products  are made with 4 basic ingredients: corn starch, rice starch, tapioca starch or potato starch. 
And those 4 dried, powdered starches are some of the  foods that raise blood sugar even higher.

I encourage people to return to REAL food: 
Fruits
Vegetables 
and nuts and seeds,  Unpasteurized cheese , 
Eggs and meats

Wheat really changed in the 70s and 80s due to a series of techniques used to increase yield, including hybridization. It was bred to be shorter and sturdier and also to have more Gliadin, (a potent appetite stimulant) 

The wheat we eat today is not the wheat that was eaten 100 years ago.

If you stop eating breads/pasta/chapatis every day, and start eating rice with chicken and vegetables, you still lose weight because rice doesn’t raise blood sugar as high as wheat, and it also doesn’t have the aAmylopectin A or the Gliadin that stimulates appetite. You won’t have the same increase in calorie intake that wheat causes. 
That’s part of the reason why foreign cultures that don’t consume wheat tend to be slenderer and healthier.

Listen, its beautiful
Theremin was invented by a Russian Leon Theremin in 1920.
Its an instrument that forms magnetic field and is played with out being touched.
Its sound is like the human voice.👌👌

[16/10/19, 9:35:40 AM] Chordi Pune: Kindly adjust”

By Shashi Tharoor

 

I have long immodestly considered myself the inventor of the term *'prepone.'* I came up with it at St Stephen’s in 1972, used it extensively in conversation and employed it in an article in JS magazine soon after. Prepone, as a back-construction from postpone, seemed so much simpler, to a teenage collegian, than saying,*“Could you move that appointment earlier?”* or *“I would like to advance that deadline.”*

 

Over the years, I was gratified to see how extensively its use had spread in India. Now, in an era where too many claim credit for other’s work, I feel it may be time to clarify the word’s origins. Is anyone aware of an earlier usage?

 

I ask because the persistence and survival of what is called *'Indian English'* (often with a sneer, as if to differentiate it from the Queen’s*“propah”* English) deserves to be taken seriously. Our English is a vigorous language, which draws strength from local roots.

 

If Americans can say *'fall'* for autumn and*'gotten'* for *'have got',* though both are archaisms in England itself, why can’t Indians say *'furlong', 'fortnight'* and *'do the needful',* even if these have fallen out of use centuries ago in London? So many words in Indian English have stood up to the only test that matters—the test of time and usage. If enough people find a word or phrase useful, it is, to my mind, legitimate.

 

Indian English is a living, practical language, used by millions every day. Many phrases we take for granted in ordinary conversation are actually quite unusual abroad—calling elders*'auntie'* or*'uncle,'* for instance, or using*'non-veg'* to convey a willingness to eat meat. That doesn’t make them wrong, or even quaint. It just makes them Indian.

 

Some Indian English was created by our media *'airdash'*(the chief minister airdashed to Delhi) and *'history sheeter' (“the police explained that habitual criminal X was a history sheeter”*, i.e. he had a long criminal record).

 

Some, like my*'prepone',* came from school and college campuses:*'mugging' (cramming hard for an exam, with much rote learning involved)* means two very different things abroad (a criminal assault by a robber, or an elaborate and often comically exaggerated expression). When an Indian student tells a foreigner he was *"mugging for an exam,”*bewilderment is guaranteed.

 

Some Indian Englishisms are merely translated from an Indian language: *"What is your good name?”*is the classic, since all Bengalis have a daak naam that they are called by, and a bhalo naam (or good name) for the record. But*“What is your good name?”* is still the most polite form, in any version of the English language, for finding out the identity of your interlocutor.

 

Some Indianisms are creative uses of an ordinary English word or phrase to reflect a particularly Indian sensibility, such as*"kindly adjust”,*said apologetically by the seventh person squeezing onto a bench meant for four. Our matrimonial ads have created their own cultural tropes— *'wheatish complexion',* of course, and better still, *'traditional with modern outlook'.*

 

But acknowledging the legitimacy of Indian English and many of its formulations doesn’t mean that *“anything goes.”* Some things are simply wrong. The Indian habit of saying *“I will return back”* is an unnecessary redundancy: if you return, you are coming back. The desi practice of using *'till'* to mean *'as long as'*is incorrect English; it is wrong to say*“I will miss you till you are away”*when you really mean is *“I will miss you till you come back”!*

 

The Indian official doesn’t *“waive off”* a fine, he just waives it, though he could wave you off if you thank him too profusely.

 

And, *'back side'*for *'rear'* causes much unwitting hilarity, as in signs proclaiming,*“entry through back side only.”*These can’t be justified under the rubric of Indian English. They are just bad English.

 

But for the rest, we have nothing to apologise about: we should defiantly celebrate their use as integral parts of our Indian English vocabulary. After all, *“we are like that only!”* And if you don’t like it, kindly adjust...!!

What is the source of light for you? To me, during the day, it is the lofty sun; at night, it is the lamp and the like. Let it be so. Tell me, in seeing the sun and the lamp, what is the source illumination? O, that is the eye! What then, when that (the eye) is closed? O, it is the intelligence! All right. What reveals the intelligence - its functions? Ah, coming to that, it is my own Self, the ‘I’! Well, your own Self is then the supreme brilliance, the ultimate light, the first and the last source of illumination! Is it not? Yes, O Lord, it is so – “I am That”.

[29/10/19, 4:24:39 PM] Moon Pishi: *Many ladies add bay leaves to our foods, especially red meat and poultry meat.*

Don't know why bay leaves are added to food?  When a woman asks why, she says: to flavor the food.

If you boil the bay leaves in a glass of water and taste it, it will have no flavor.

So why do you put bay leaves in the meat?

The addition of bay leaves to meat converts triglycerides to monounsaturated fats, and for experimentation and confirmation:
 
 Cut the chicken in half and cook each half in a pan and place on one bay leaf, and the other without bay leaf and observe the amount of fat in both pans.

If you have bay leaves, there is no need for a pharmacy.  Recent scientific studies have shown that bay leaves have many benefits.

  Helps to get rid of many serious health problems and illnesses,

*The benefits of bay leaf are: -*

Bay leaf treats digestive disorders and helps eliminate lumps.

  Heartburn,

  Acidity

  Constipation,

It regulates bowel movement by drinking hot bay tea.

It lowers blood sugar and bay leaf is also an antioxidant,

It allows the body to produce insulin by eating it or drinking bay tea for a month.

Eliminates bad cholesterol and relieves the body of triglycerides.

Very useful in treating colds, flu and severe cough as it is a rich source of vitamin "C", you can boil the leaves and inhale steam to get rid of phlegm and reduce the severity of cough.

Bay leaf protects the heart from seizures and strokes as it contains cardiovascular protective compounds.

Rich in acids such as caffeic acid, quercetin, eigonol and bartolinide, substances that prevent the formation of cancer cells in the body.

Eliminates insomnia and anxiety, if taken before bed, helps you relax and sleep peacefully.

Drinking a cup of boiled bay leaves twice a day breaks kidney stones and cures infections ...

I loved this interpretation of Prayer.* What is a prayer? Prayer doesn't just happen when we kneel or put our hands together and focus and expect things from God. *Thinking positive and wishing good for others is a prayer.* When you hug a friend. *That's a prayer.* When you cook something to nourish family and friends. *That's a prayer.* When we send off our near and dear ones and say, 'drive safely' or 'be safe'. *That's a prayer.* When you are helping someone in need by giving your time and energy. *You are praying.* When you forgive someone by your heart. *That is prayer.* *Prayer is a vibration. A feeling. A thought. Prayer is the voice of love, friendship, genuine relationships. Prayer is an expression of your silent being.*
Keep praying always... Stay Blessed🙏
i hope it might help all of us♥️♥️

ভালবাসা হল - বাড়ি ফিরতে দেরী হলে যখন মা বলে " কি হল আজ অনেক দেরী হয়ে গেল "!

ভালবাসা হল - কাজের থেকে ফিরে বাবা যখন প্রশ্ন করে "আজ খুব খাটাখাটুনি গেল "?

ভালবাসা হল - বৌদি যখন বলে "কিরে মেয়ে দেখেছি তোর জন্য । তোর কাউকে পছন্দ থাকলে বল "!

ভালবাসা হল - যখন দাদা বলে " তুই একদম চিন্তা করিস না । আমি তো আছিই"!

ভালবাসা হল - মন খারাপ বুঝতে পেরে ছোটো বোন যখন বলে " চলনা দাদা , একটু ঘুরে আসি "!

ভালবাসা হল - প্রিয় বন্ধু যখন জড়িয়ে ধরে বলে " তোকে ছাড়া কিছু জমে না রে " ! 

এইগুলো খুবই ছোট কিন্ত জীবনের অমুল্য মুহূর্ত । এইগুলো হারিয়ো না । 

ভালবাসা শুধুমাত্র বয়ফ্রেন্ড বা গার্লফ্রেন্ড থাকা নয়। 

ভালবাস তাদের যারা তোমার জীবনের  এক একটা বিশেষ  অংশ জুড়ে আছে । 

যখন ছোট্ট মেয়েটি বাবার মাথা যন্ত্রনা করছে বলে কপাল টিপে দেয় - সেটাই ভালবাসা ।

যখন স্বামীর জন্য চা করতে গিয়ে স্ত্রী তাতে একটা চুমুক দিয়ে দেখে চিনি টা ঠিকঠাক হয়েছে কিনা ! - সেটাই ভালবাসা ।

যখন মা সন্তানের জন্য খাবারের বড় টুকরোটা সরিয়ে রাখে - সেটাই ভালবাসা ।

পিচ্ছিল রাস্তায় যখন তোমার বন্ধু তোমার হাতটা শক্ত করে ধরে রাখে - সেটাই ভালবাসা ।

ফোনের ইনবক্সে যখন দাদার মেসেজ আসে - কিরে ঠিকঠাক পৌঁছে গেছিস তো ! - সেটাই ভালবাসা ।

একটা ছেলে একটা মেয়ের হাত ধরাধরি করে ঘুরে বেড়ানোর নাম ভালবাসা নয় ।

ভালবাসা হল - যখন তোমার একটা একটা ছোট্ট মেসেজ তোমার বন্ধুর মুখে হাসি ফোটায় ।
 
নিরাপত্তা , বন্ধন , বিশ্বাস আর একটু যত্নের নামই ভালবাসা ।

[01/12/19, 10:18:39 AM] Chordi Pune: Fresh Banana Leaf 🌝
For those battling with bedssores. 
Anyway, since most of us still have elderly loved ones to look after, I would like to share with you the healing properties of banana leaf.
My diabetic dad suffered from one persistent bed sore a few months ago on his sitting bone. 
Just when we thought we have lost the battle, our maid suggested for us to try her kampung method of covering the bedsore with a fresh banana leaf.
Like a miracle, the bedsore started healing within 48 hours and was gone after a week. So, if you know of anyone battling with bedsores, may we recommend them the use of fresh banana leaf.🌱🌱🌱🌱


 For those who want to try, just wash and dry a fresh banana leaf and place it over a freshly cleaned bedsore".    *Please Share this Helpful Information to All your Family & Friends....*🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
[04/12/19, 10:13:29 AM] Chordi Pune: I think this text is very beautiful, very true .... !

 Hardly the day started and ... it is already six o'clock in the evening.
Barely arrived on Monday and it's already Friday.
... and the month is already over.
... and the year is almost up.
... and already 40, 50, 60 or 70 years of our lives have passed.
... and we realize that we lost our parents, friends.
and we realize that it is too late to go back ...
So ... Let's try, however, to take full advantage of the time we have left ...
Let's not stop looking for activities that we like ...
Let's put color in our greyness ...
Let's smile at the little things in life that put balm in our hearts.
And yet, we must continue to enjoy serenely the time that remains. Let's try to eliminate the "after" ...
I do it after ...
I will say after ...
I will think about it after ...
We leave everything for later as if "after" was ours.
Because what we do not understand is that:
after, the coffee cools ...
after, priorities change ...
after, the charm is broken ...
after, health passes ...
after, the children grow up ...
after, the parents get older ...
after, the promises are forgotten ...
after, the day becomes the night ...
after, life ends ...
And after that it's often too late ....
So ... leave nothing for later ...
Because always waiting for later, we can lose the best moments,
the best experiences,
the best friends,
the best family ...
The day is today ... The moment is now ...

We are no longer at the age where we can afford to postpone until tomorrow what needs to be done right away.
So let's see if you'll have time to read this message and then share it.
Or maybe you'll leave it for ... "later" ...
And you will not share it "ever" ....

Even to share with those who are not yet "seniors”😎

[14/12/19, 5:05:28 PM] Chordi Pune: *I feel like reading this again and again & again.. hope u will also...👇*

*A famous writer was in his study room. He picked up his pen and started writing:*

**Last year, I had a surgery and my gall bladder was removed. I had to stay in the bed, due to this surgery, for a very long time.* 

**The same year I reached the age of 60 years and had to give up my favourite job. I had spent 30 years of my life with this publishing company.* 

**The same year I experienced the sorrow of the death of my father.*

**And in the same year my son failed in his medical exam because he met with an accident. He had to stay in hospital with the plaster for several weeks. The destruction of the vehicle was another great loss.* 

*At the end he wrote: Oh God! It was such bad year!!* 

*When the writer's wife entered the room, she found her husband looking very sad & lost in his thoughts. From behind his back she read what was written on that paper. She left the room silently and came back with another paper and replaced it with that of her husband's.*

*When the writer saw this paper, he found his name written on it with following lines:*

**Last year I finally got rid of my gall bladder due to which I had spent years in pain...*

**I turned 60 with sound health and got retired from my job. Now I can utilize my time to write something better with more focus and peace...*

**The same year my father, at the age of 95, without depending on anyone or without any critical illness met his Creator...*

 **The same year, God blessed my son with a new life. My car was destroyed but my son stayed alive without getting any disability...*

*At the end she wrote:* 

*This year was an immense blessing of God and it passed well!!!*

 *The writer was indeed happy and amazed at such beautiful and encouraging interpretation of the happenings in his life, that year!!!*

*Moral: In daily lives we must see that it's not happiness that makes us grateful but grate-fulness that makes us happy.*

*To all my lovely friends & family members...*

*Think positive*.
*Be happy. Stay Blessed*. 😊😊

[26/12/19, 11:09:37 AM] Chordi Pune: A Christmas Story🌲🎁...

GRANDMA & SANTA CLAUS

I remember my first Christmas adventure with Grandma. I was just a kid...
I remember tearing across town on my bike to visit her on the day my big sister dropped the bomb:
"There is no Santa Claus," she jeered. "Even dummies know that!"

My Grandma was not the gushy kind, never had been. I fled to her that day because I knew she would be straight with me. I knew Grandma always told the truth, and I knew that the truth always went down a whole lot easier when swallowed with one of her "world-famous" cinnamon buns. I knew they were world-famous, because Grandma said so. It had to be true.
Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm. Between bites, I told her everything.
She was ready for me. "No Santa Claus?" she snorted..."Ridiculous! Don't believe it. That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad!! Now, put on your coat, and let's go."

"Go? Go where, Grandma?" I asked. I hadn't even finished my second world-famous cinnamon bun. "Where" turned out to be Kerby's General Store, the one store in town that had a little bit of just about everything.
As we walked through its doors, Grandma handed me ten dollars. That was a bundle in those days.
"Take this money," she said, "and buy something for someone who needs it. I'll wait for you in the car." Then she turned and walked out of Kerby's.

I was only eight years old. I'd often gone shopping with my mother, but never had I shopped for anything all by myself. The store seemed big and crowded, full of people scrambling to finish their Christmas shopping.
For a few moments I just stood there, confused, clutching that ten-dollar bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for.
I thought of everybody I knew: my family, my friends, my neighbours, the kids at school, the people who went to my church.

I was just about thought out, when I suddenly thought of Bobby Decker. He was a kid with bad breath and messy hair, and he sat right behind me in Mrs. Pollock's grade-two class. Bobby Decker didn't have a coat. I knew that because he never went out to recess during the winter. His mother always wrote a note, telling the teacher that he had a cough, but all us kids knew that Bobby Decker didn't have a cough; he didn't have a good coat. I fingered the ten-dollar bill with growing excitement. I would buy Bobby Decker a coat!
I settled on a red corduroy one that had a hood to it. It looked real warm, and he would like that.

"Is this a Christmas present for someone?" the lady behind the counter asked kindly, as I laid my ten dollars down.
"Yes, ma'am," I replied shyly. "It's for Bobby."

The nice lady smiled at me, as I told her about how Bobby really needed a winter coat. I didn't get any change, but she put the coat in a bag, smiled again, and wished me a Merry Christmas.

That evening, Grandma helped me wrap the coat (a little tag fell out of the coat, and Grandma tucked it in her Bible) in Christmas paper and ribbons and wrote, "To Bobby, From Santa Claus" on it.

Grandma said that Santa always insisted on secrecy. Then she drove me over to Bobby Decker's house, explaining as we went that I was now and forever officially, one of Santa's helpers.
Grandma parked down the street from Bobby's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk.
Then Grandma gave me a nudge. "All right, Santa Claus," she whispered, "get going."

I took a deep breath, dashed for Bobby's front door, dropped the present down on his step, pounded his door and flew back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma.
Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open. Finally it did, and there stood Bobby...

Fifty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those moments spent shivering, beside my Grandma, in Bobby Decker's bushes.
That night, I realized that those awful rumours about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said they were -- ridiculous. Santa was alive and well, and we were on his team.

I still have that Bible, with the coat tag tucked inside: $19.95...That store clerk was one of Santa's helpers, too!😊

May you always have LOVE to share,
HEALTH to spare and
FRIENDS who care.

And may you always believe in the magic of Santa Claus!💝💫🌟

[31/12/19, 2:32:12 PM] Moon Pishi: Glad to share a beautiful Hindi poem - 

*December Aur January Ka Rishta.* 

Don't know who wrote this but found it very meaningful. Just 2 months but recreated as two individuals, two entities, two different personalities  and yet complementing each other beautifully..

कितना अजीब है ना, 
*दिसंबर और जनवरी का रिश्ता?*
जैसे पुरानी यादों और नए वादों का किस्सा...

दोनों वक़्त के राही है, 
दोनों ने ठोकर खायी है...

यूँ तो दोनों का हैं
वही चेहरा-वही रंग,
उतनी ही तारीखें और 
उतनी ही ठंड...
पर पहचान अलग है दोनों की
अलग है अंदाज़ और 
अलग हैं ढंग...
 
एक अन्त है, 
एक शुरुआत
जैसे रात से सुबह,
और सुबह से रात...

एक में याद है
दूसरे मे आस,
एक को है तजुर्बा, 
दूसरे को विश्वास...

दोनों जुड़े हुए है ऐसे
धागे के दो छोर के जैसे,
पर देखो दूर रहकर भी 
साथ निभाते है कैसे...

जो दिसंबर छोड़ के जाता है
उसे जनवरी अपनाता है,
और जो जनवरी के वादे हैं
उन्हें दिसम्बर निभाता है...

कैसे जनवरी से 
दिसम्बर के सफर मे
११ महीने लग जाते है...
लेकिन दिसम्बर से जनवरी बस
१ पल मे पहुंच जाते हैं!!

जब ये दूर जाते हैं 
तो हाल बदल देते हैं,
और जब पास आते हैं 
तो साल बदल देते हैं...

देखने मे ये साल के महज़ 
दो महीने ही तो लगते हैं,
लेकिन... 
सब कुछ बिखेरने और समेटने
का वो कायदा भी रखते हैं...

दोनों ने मिलकर ही तो 
बाकी महीनों को बांध रखा है,
अपनी जुदाई को 
दुनिया के लिए 
एक त्यौहार बना रखा है..!

Wishing a Happy Year Ending to All with Bright Hopes for a Fulfilling & Satisfying New Year ahead.. 👍😊💐
[31/12/19, 4:45:49 PM] Chordi Pune: Beautiful poem! 👌👌

[05/01/20, 4:07:45 PM] Chordi Pune: Wow Puchu!!👍
Remarkable for your age 2 years ago...
Reveals your sense of wonder and inner search for meaning at such a young age. The style and choice of words are quite impressive!

Carry on, girl! 
 
The poem has a sense of despair and hopelessnesss which is perhaps natural at this stage of life when you begin questioning life. This search for meaning will surely lead you on to a deeper realization...
All the best to you!

[06/01/20, 8:04:17 PM] Moon Pishi: A great thought !!! 👇

*Who hurts you!!*

_When Abraham Lincoln became the president of America, his father was a shoemaker.  And, naturally, egoistic people were very much offended that a shoemaker’s son should become the president.   On the first day, as Abraham Lincoln entered to give his inaugural address, just in the middle, one man stood up.  He was a very rich aristocrat.  He said, “Mr. Lincoln, you should not forget that your father used to make shoes for my family.”  And the whole Senate laughed; they thought that they had made a fool of Abraham Lincoln._

_But certain people are made of a totally different mettle. Lincoln looked at the man directly in the eye and said, *“Sir, I know that my father used to make shoes for your family, and there will be many others here because he made shoes the way nobody else can”. He was a creator. His shoes were not just shoes; he poured his whole soul into them. I want to ask you, have you any complaint? Because I know how to make shoes myself. If you have any complaint I can make you another pair of shoes. But as far as I know, nobody has ever complained about my father’s shoes. He was a genius, a great creator and I am proud of my father”.*_

_The whole Senate was struck dumb. They could not understand what kind of man Abraham Lincoln was. He was proud because his father did his job so well, with so much enthusiasm, such a passion, and perfection._

*_It does not matter what you do. What matters is how you do it of your own accord, with your own vision, with your own love.  Then whatever you touch becomes gold._*

*Moral*

_No one can hurt you without your consent. It is not what happens to us that hurts us. It is our response that hurts us._

*“Ships don’t sink because of the water around them; ships sink because of the water that gets in them. Don’t let what’s happening around you get inside you and weigh you down”*

WONDERFUL PIECE FOR THE VERY MATURE MIND.

[20/02/20, 10:11:23 AM] Chordi Pune: হঠাৎ একদিন " ভালবাসা " এসে আমায় বলল,   " সে " নাকি রিটায়ার হয়ে যাচ্ছে ।। আমি তো অবাক !!
ভালবাসা রিটায়ার হয়ে গেলে আমার মত মানুষেরা বাঁচবে কি নিয়ে ??      যারা ভালবাসাহীন থাকতেই পারে না ।।

             আমি দৌড়ে গেলাম " বিশ্বাসের" কাছে , গিয়ে বললাম , জানো ! ভালবাসা রিটায়ার হয়ে যাচ্ছে ..... 

"বিশ্বাস"  শুনে বলল : আমারও ওয়ারেন্টি পিরিয়ড শেষ হয়ে গেছে ।।

               আমি হতভম্ব ! আমি তাই শুনে এবার গেলাম , " মনের " কাছে ,      

 " মন"  বলল :  তার নাকি লাইফ টাইম অফার শেষ ।।

                আমি তখন রূদ্ধশ্বাসে "স্বপ্নের" কাছে গেলাম ,

"স্বপ্ন" বলল :  এখন আর আমাকে কেউ দেখেইনা , সবাই নিজের নিজের আমিত্বকেই বড় করে দেখে ।।

              আমি তো নির্বাক , মূক , মৌন হয়ে গেলাম ।।
একি ! সবাই তো একে একে চলে যাচ্ছে , তবে কি হবে আমাদের মত মানুষদের ?? মাছ যেমন জল ছাড়া বাঁচতে পারেনা , তেমন ভালবাসাহীন আমাদের মত মানুষেরা কিভাবে থাকবে ?? এই ভেবে হতাশ হয়ে মাথা নিচু করে রাস্তা দিয়ে হাঁটছিলাম ।।

                হঠাৎ দেখি , কার স্পর্শ আমার হাতে ! মুখ তুলে দেখি , " আশা" - মিটিমিটি স্মিত হাসি হাসছে আমার দিকে চেয়ে ....

                 হেসে " আশা " বলছে :   যতক্ষন আমি আছি , তোমার সাথে , তোমার কোনো চিন্তা নেই ।।

                  আমি বললাম , জানো আশা !   ভালবাসা , বিশ্বাস , স্বপ্ন, মন সবাই একে একে  হারিয়ে যাচ্ছে , দুরে সরে যাচ্ছে ......

  তখন সপ্রতিভ ভঙ্গিতে " আশা " বলল :  আমি থাকলে সব থাকবে ।। তোমার মধ্যে আমাকে গভীর ভাবে গেঁথে নাও , দেখবে ভালবাসা, বিশ্বাস , স্বপ্ন, মন  সব একে একে তোমার কাছে ফিরে আসবে ।। 

                  তুমি শুধু আমাকে ছেড়োনা ।। 

আমি তখন আনন্দে আপ্লুত হয়ে  " আশা " কে দৃঢ়ভাবে নিজের বুকে টেনে নিলাম ।। আর বললাম ,      " আশা " যে কোনো পরিস্হিতিতে , যে কোনো মানসিকতায় থাকিনা কেন  , "তোমাকে" ছাড়বনা।।

                   আশা তখন আমার হাত শক্ত করে ধরে চলতে থাকল ।।

                     আর আমিও "আশা" কে নিয়ে সামনের দিকে এগিয়ে এগিয়ে চললাম .........।। 


 খুব ভাল লাগল তাই share করলাম ।🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿

[19/03/20, 4:43:34 PM] ‪+44 7713 759532‬: Not in terms of number of deaths and cases, all but they are in midst of semi lockdown. There are still some people working and there is no panic yet in the supermarkets and things are okay
[19/03/20, 4:44:55 PM] ‪+44 7713 759532‬: Thanks Rumna maashi. We were both asked to work from home from Monday. Hope you guys are taking care as well
[19/03/20, 4:46:23 PM] ‪+44 7713 759532‬: I believe there is a high possiblity of lockdown in London. I have been told and it is in some news papers that they expect it by Friday/weekend. There is a lot of panic buying and not much is available in the supermarkets. We are okay for now but it depends on how long we might be in Lockdown
[19/03/20, 4:47:51 PM] Partho Jethu: People are buying groceries in Delhi like there's no tomorrow. Milk powder, Maggi, noodles, sold out in kirana stores
[19/03/20, 4:48:27 PM] Partho Jethu: Unlike London, toilet paper is still on shelf. 😉
[19/03/20, 4:50:57 PM] ‪+44 7713 759532‬: Haha. By the way I have been told reliably that Modi is most likely to announce lockdown at 8 pm tonight
[19/03/20, 4:51:59 PM] ‪+44 7500 455661‬: I don’t understand this obsession with toilet paper! People are going insane about it
[19/03/20, 4:52:15 PM] ‪+44 7500 455661‬: No toilet papers available
[19/03/20, 4:57:58 PM] Partho Jethu: Its as if they will crap more now that they are at home. Maybe they crapped in office. Well, Indians have the advantage.
[19/03/20, 4:58:57 PM] Chordi Pune: Maharashtra has the highest number of reported cases out of which a sizeable number is from Pune. So a lockdown here is quite likely..
[19/03/20, 5:00:10 PM] Chordi Pune: 😆🤣🤣
[19/03/20, 5:00:23 PM] Partho Jethu: Please stock up medicine supplies to last till end April. Including basic antibiotics, tummy drugs, anti allergic, etc.

[20/03/20, 3:21:30 PM] Chordi Pune: In the coming week or two, India as a nation is being watched by the world. By the more developed economies like Italy and more influential world powers like USA. By neighbours like China and further away countries like Iran. They are all watching if India is *able* enough to deal with a looming threat to the healthcare, economy and life of its citizens. At the verge of an exponential explosion, are we as a nation smart enough, strong enough, kind enough and responsible enough to fight against a common enemy. An enemy that is being feared world over. It's up to us to set an example to all the ones who are watching with intent, if we succeed or fail. People who are looking at us with skepticism because our reputation of being a crowded, overpopulated and unhygienic group of people precedes us. We have a chance to show the world that we are a young, vigilant and united country. And we can fight what might seem so insurmountable.
Do your part. Maintain social distancing, stock up foods but leave enough for others. Have compassion for someone who is underprivileged, use the public resources responsibly. *These are warlike times and it is our chance to create a history. Don't let it pass.* *Together, we can!*
[20/03/20, 3:23:11 PM] Partho Jethu: We don't have a choice. Unofficially we are already in stage 3.

[23/03/20, 9:09:03 AM] Chordi Pune: Kathleen O'Meara's poem, 'And People Stayed Home,' written in 1869. 

And people stayed home
and read books and listened
and rested and exercised
and made art and played
and learned new ways of being
and stopped
and listened deeper
someone meditated
someone prayed
someone danced
someone met their shadow
and people began to think differently
and people healed
and in the absence of people who lived in ignorant ways,
dangerous, meaningless and heartless,
even the earth began to heal
and when the danger ended
and people found each other
grieved for the dead people
and they made new choices
and dreamed of new visions
and created new ways of life
and healed the earth completely
just as they were healed themselves.
🙏

[01/04/20, 2:43:18 PM] Chordi Pune: We fell asleep in one world, and woke up in another.

Suddenly Disney is out of magic,
Paris is no longer romantic,
New York doesn't stand up anymore,
the Chinese wall is no longer a fortress, and Mecca is empty.

Hugs & kisses suddenly become weapons, and not visiting parents & friends becomes an act of love.

Suddenly you realise that power, beauty & money are worthless, and can't get you the oxygen you're fighting for.

The world continues its life and it is beautiful. It only puts humans in cages. I think it's sending us a message:

"You are not necessary. The air, earth, water and sky without you are fine. When you come back, remember that you are my guests. Not my masters."

So few shops are open, I count them on my finger 
 
Ginni shouted, "Go buy alu, peyaj, posto and pheesh!"
My dhooti loosen in fear, I deyar not defy her ooeesh 
I did bajar to the content of her heart 
Ginni ooeel be relax, I did my part 

I was oalking back home, whistling like Rajesh Khanna
My tholey full and heavy, for ginni's ranna 
Suddenly I felt a pain deep in my pacha
In anger I turn around, "ke re beta, shuorer bacha?"

Oh Ma Kaali! what do I see
Saala poolish swinging his danda at me
I ran like Naxalite, like Maradona, Pele
Who ooeel eat Ginni's pheesh curry, ami morey gele?

Glad you listened to it and liked it!

And building immunity should now be the focus along with basic precautions. Lockdown has served its purpose of allowing the government to buy time.
 I was however struck by the oxymoron 'marattok immunity'.

[16/06/20, 10:06:15 AM] Moon Pishi: How Bollywood nepotism gang kills Talent 

In February, Kamal Khan tweeted that Yashraj, SajidNadiadwala, Salmankahan, Balaji, KJo, DineshVijayan, Bhansali, T-Series have all boycotted Sushant Singh Rajput and he will have to do TV series or short films to make a loving. What will a person do other than hang him self in depression if the whole world forsakes him. No one know how a gang can boycott a person ? 
Susanth was a brilliant student, a physics Olympiad winner and a topper in engineering entrance 
He quit his engineering degree to become an actor and at 34 his dream of acting was virtually dead 

Karan 🤡 is a monster. He is a viscous bully who will destroy anyone whom he doesn’t like 
If your a guest in his show, you have to laugh at his crude childish tormenting jokes. You have to bear all his tyranny in the name of sissy humour 
Or else he will witch-hunt you 

He, YRF, SRK, Bhansali and some more are all a gang 
You can’t survive in Bollywood without their blessings. It is such a shame that India’s top movie industry which makes second highest number of movies in the world is controlled by half dozen nepotists. Shouldn’t Bollywood have been a melting pot, where anyone with talent, skill, hard work, dedication can succeed like in any other form of business ?
No. You need to belong to particular clan, religion, have certain surnames and only then you will be let inside. Or else you are always an outsider 

Sushant Singh was virtually trolled, ragged and bullied. He was an intelligent, intellectual and well read man unlike these school dropouts like KJo, Aalia, Kapoor family kids 

Sushant Singh's Insta acc is full of stuffs like energy, cosmos, sanskrit shlokas, coding, algorithm and other interesting stuffs. He was a thinker. People like him rose from scratch and a potential threat to nepotism products.

K🤡 made him delete those tweets and insta messages. In every Coffee with 🤡, he made fun of him and all the guests always placed him last in all the polls. 
He made a pathetic movie called Drive on Netflix with Sushanth and virtually killed his career 
Since 2 years he was being oppressed as he had refused few movies by YRF and chose to act in Shekar Kapoor’s PAANI Movie 

Rumours were spread with help of gossip writers in Bollywood that he is Debaunch, short tempered, arrogant, difficult to work with 
He had no movies in his hand though his last movie CHICHOREE was a super hit 
Most of his movies were given to Ranveer singh 
Sushant got so desperate to please this group that he dropped his surname Rajput to please Bansali gang and faced the ire of nationalists 

I still remember him begging his fans on Instagram to watch his movie SONCHARIYA saying I have no God father in Bollywood and I will be out of job if you don’t watch my movie 
Imagine how hard it might have been for him
He was handsome, his smile was charismatic, he was well read, intelligent and he was very good in acting Dept 
Still he didn’t make it as Bollywood nepotism kills talent. Hence it makes so few good movies and 90 percent of Bollywood movies are trash
PS - it is first time I have agreed with what 2BHK fame Rohini singh has tweeted

[16/06/20, 11:24:05 AM] Chordi Pune: Aren’t numerous evidences staring us in the face? Aren’t people speaking out? (On hindsight, of course..which is always easier and more convenient)
But...whether that will make any change, cannot be guaranteed!
[16/06/20, 11:29:53 AM] Partho Jethu: In the case of Kangana, i really dont know if she speaks from having undergone similar experiences or she has axes to grind or maybe both. Nepotism has plagued the other pop phenomenon of the country for many years - cricket
[16/06/20, 12:00:58 PM] Chordi Pune: Of course! Kangana’s outburst is not the point. Nepotism is there everywhere, in big or small ways. That doesn’t take away from the enormity of the present situation.

Along with that our nonchalance...yeh to chalta hai! That makes it all the more alarming...
People crumbling under the enormous pressure, taking such drastic steps...unmindful of the loved ones!! Where are we headed?
[16/06/20, 12:24:36 PM] Tilok Dadu: Does that justify committing suicide? This type of game playing can happen in any profession.
[16/06/20, 12:31:58 PM] Chordi Pune: The most alarming thing is the collapse of emotional resilience...
More than anything else. The sense of alienation and disconnect. 
Nepotism has always been there, will be there in future. That’s not the problem.
[16/06/20, 12:38:21 PM] Moon Pishi: Of course there must be more to it than this.
Actually , he left a promising future for his dreams and probably the dreams were not getting realised after a while.

[16/06/20, 12:46:41 PM] Prateek Dasgupta: Guilt or whatever prompted Karan’s outpouring for Sushant Singh Rajput should not be put to trial with such blatant blame. By pinpointing a single person, aren’t we going against what we preach about mental health
[16/06/20, 1:58:12 PM] Partho Jethu: Valid point. Social media allows us to express anything we feel with no sensitivity attached.

[16/06/20, 3:09:25 PM] Moon Pishi: He is quite expressive and  confident .
[16/06/20, 3:16:34 PM] Moon Pishi: सलमान खान स्टारर फ़िल्म #दबंग के डायरेक्टर Abhinav Singh Kashyap 

My appeal to the Government to launch a detailed investigation. 

Rest in peace Sushant Singh Rajput… Om Shanti.. But your fight continues…

The suicide of Sushant Singh Rajput brings to the forefront a much bigger problem of what many of us have been dealing with. Exactly what might compel a person to commit suicide?? I fear his death is just the tip of the iceberg just like the #metoo movement was for a much bigger malaise in Bollywood.

The death of Sushant Singh Rajput brings under scanner the role YRF talent Management Agency might have played in pushing him towards his suicide but that is for the authorities to investigate. These people don’t make careers. They ruin your career and life. Having suffered personally for a decade, I can confidently say every Talent Manager and all Talent Management Agencies of Bollywood are a potential death Trap for Artists. They are all basically white collared Dalaals and everyone is involved. They all have an unspoken code of conduct they adhere to. Their one simple mantra is, “Hamaam me sab nange aur jo nange nahin hain, unko nanga karo kyonki agar ek bhi pakda gaya to sab pakde jayenge”. Following is mostly their modus Operandi. 

First the talent scout(Casting Directors, etc.) working on a cut/commission spots a needy wild talent from out of Mumbai with little connections or property.

The talent is then lured with free invites to Bollywood parties and random Restaurant launches on the pretext of introducing them to celebrities. The Blinding glamour of celebs and lure of easy money is unleashed on the unsuspecting. Mind you they are all ignored and treated very badly at these parties so they feel demoralized and their self-confidence breaks.

Once the confidence is broken, the scouts offer them a multi-year exclusivity contracts and pressure them to sign-up for it by promising to protect them from predators or offering a pittance. Mind you, breaking these legal contracts means heavy penalties for these budding talents but the scout makes sure through bullying and coercion that there is very little option for the talent but to sign up.

Once the talent is signed up with the Talent management agency, they give up their right to exercise free choice and their discretion in any matter concerning career and they are made to work as bonded labor with very little money. Even if they are brave and manage to escape the clutches of their Talent Management agency somehow, they are systematically boycotted and their name smeared till they jump ship to another Agency in the hope of a better tommorrow.

But that tommorrow never comes. Their new agency turns out to be the same. Over a period of few years, mostly the prime of any actor, the talent is repeatedly broken till they either commit suicide or they succumb to Prostitution and escort services (Yes male escorts also) to feed the ego and sexual appetite of the rich and powerful, not just in Bollywood but also in Corporate world and politics.

My experience is no different. I have experienced exploitation and bullying first hand

Arbaaz Khan on Dabangg and ever since. So here is my story 10 years after Dabangg. The reason I moved out of making Dabangg 2 ten years ago is because Arbaaz Khan in collusion with Sohail Khan and family was trying to take control of my career by bullying me. Arbaaz Khan sabotaged my second project with Shree Ashtavinayak Films that I was signed up with by personally calling their head Mr. Raj Mehta and threatening him with dire consequences if they made a film with me. I had to return the signing money to Shree Ashtavinayak films and moved to Viacom Pictures. They did the same thing. Only this time the sabotager was Sohail Khan and he intimidated the then Viacom CEO Vikram Malhotra. My project was sabotaged and I was made to return my signing fee of Rupees 7 Crores plus interest of Ninety odd lacs. Its only then that Reliance Entertainment came to my rescue and we forged an enduring partnership for my film Besharam.

But lo behold... Mr. Salman Khan and family sabotaged the release of the film and got their PROs to run a sustained negative smear campaign against me and my film BESHARAM before release. This scared the distributors from buying my film. Reliance Entertainment and I were capable and courageous enough to release the film ourselves but the battle had just begun. My enemies, which there were many ran a sustained negative Trolling and badmouthing campaign against the film till the Box Office of my film collapsed. But to their horror, Besharam had still netted 58 crores before it went out of theaters.

So they fought on... They sabotaged the Satellite release of the film that was pre-sold to Mr. Jayanti Lal Gada who was the main agregator for Zee Telefilms those days. With Reliances goodwill, they were able to re-negotiate the satellite rights sale with Gada for a much lesser price.

Over the next few years, all my projects and creative endeavors have been sabotaged and I have been repeatedly threatened with life and rape threats given to/for the female members of my family. The sustained gaslighting and bullying destroyed my mental health and that of my family and led to my divorce and breaking up of my family in 2017. They erred and sent some of these threats as texts, sent to me as sms from several numbers. Armed with evidence, I went to the police in 2017 to file an FIR which they refused to register but registered a non-cognizable complaint. When the threats continued, I forced the police to trace the numbers but they couldn't be traced back to Sohail Khan(the suspected sender). My complaint remains open to date and I still have all the evidence.

My enemies are sharp, cunning and always attack me from the back and stay Hidden. But the best part is after 10 years, I know who my enemies are. Let it be known that they are Salim Khan, Salman Khan, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan. There are many other small fry’s but Salman Khan family is the head of this venomous serpant. They use a clever mix of their ill-gotten money, political clout and connections with the underworld to intimidate anyone and everyone. Unfortunately truth is on my side and I am not going to give up like Sushant Singh Rajput. I refuse to cow down and will fight on till I see the end of either them or me. Enough tolerance. It's time to fight back. 

So this is not a threat, it’s an open challenge. Sushant Singh Rajput has moved on and I hope he is happier wherever he is but I will make sure that no more innocent will kill himself over lack of work with dignity in Bollywood. I hope suffering actors and creative artists will share my post on various social media platforms as will the media and people who patronize the entertainment industry.

Warm regards,

Abhinav Singh Kashyap

Please share and forward this as much as you can.

[16/06/20, 8:56:00 PM] Nandinie Cousin: ‎This message was deleted.
[16/06/20, 8:58:31 PM] Nandinie Cousin: The phenomenon of nepotism has had its discourse in our culture for a long time, it is simply a modern extension of caste system and the relation between kinship and occupation. If you look at it with the lens of  Brahmanical caste system you will find it very similar, the change is simply from caste to status. There is power dynamics in this system and these celebrities do not want to give away their power and wealth to that someone who is struggling while climbing the social ladder of this industry. 

The movie industry is extremely stratified and hierarchical, it does have the power to exercise social exclusion. Now our subjective understanding might not approach this topic with discerning critism because it does not affect us greatly. But those who have aspirations and the right amount of talent to enter this industry, which is all that is required, have a very hard time finding their own space in this industry. Our country which is so incumbent on democracy and it does not reflect an ounce of equal opportunity to all individuals. So yes nepotism is pathological to society just like the Brahmanical system. In that it was caste which stratified the society, in this industry we have status and money.
[16/06/20, 9:30:46 PM] Nandinie Cousin: As far as his decision is concerned, it is a consequence of this pathology which is the product of highly alienating work environment. When our life shifts itself from humanist grounds to materialism, mental health comes into existence.

It may not have been a well touched upon discourse in the 20th century but in this generation which manifests extreme stratification and alienation because of the division of labour, bureaucracy and capitalism, the individual has become alienated.

Having said this, I do not condone in any way social media's response of trolling and cyberbullying but I do believe that these conversations should take place.
 Karan Johar may not have been solely responsible for this system but he is a symbol of that continuous line of privilege and latent oppression that this industry projects. It is the same complacency which had helped Harvey Weinstein and now helping this industry, to abuse their power to maintain stature and wealth in the eyes of the public.
[16/06/20, 9:47:41 PM] ‪+44 7713 759532‬: This has been the case with every industry and in every country. Whether you are in UK, US or countries in Europe, whatever the industry, there is always some sort of divide based on race, or public school (state school) or private school, working class or privileged class. You may compare or blame it on the Brahmanical caste system but here we talk about effects of colonialism or the empire mentality and in the US, the slavery and racial profiling. I am also not sure whether this exists because of capitalism. This divide exists even more in purely socialist countries- whether Russia, China or ex Soviet Union countries and then you also have to toe the party line without having a right to protest. You may hear about the details in the movie/media industry but this issue is the same within the legal, banking, farming and all other commercial industries. It follows the simple logic that the rich and powerful would like to hold on to the power and influence as long as they can and would look down upon any new entry eager to make a big mark and challenge their position. It is not to say that we have to accept this as a status quo but this is a struggle that quite a lot of people face. Ultimately, it all boils down to the simple fact that I think we should all remember while struggling with our careers that everything we do is just "work". It does not define you and it is not be all there is to you. We have to find happiness in small things and live a life filled with gratitude.
[16/06/20, 9:51:24 PM] Rishika: I quite agree that one's work doesn't define them. Unfortunately we live in a world (India being prominent among the countries who behave in this way) where these kind of achievements are meant to define you. Doing things that make one happy are many a times, not encouraged and in extreme cases, ostracised. 
Which brings us back to the sad situation where mental health is far from being prioritised. In India it's yet to become "normal" to seek therapy, to reach out when you need help as it shows how "weak" or "hysterical" you are as a person. :/
[16/06/20, 9:52:19 PM] Rishika: Saying that we have to find happiness is majorly challenging the conditioning we have all grown up with, which makes it all the more difficult.

[16/06/20, 10:10:33 PM] Chordi Pune: I love the arguments put forth by  the new generation ! So well observed , analysed and effectively expressed. Need to re-read  all of it. Loved the concluding statement by Arpan..
[16/06/20, 10:18:54 PM] Nandinie Cousin: It is a systemic social fact, no doubt about it. The difference is that your perspective towards life is helping you achieve peace in life, although may have had your own struggles. However, you have to understand that is also a privilege these days. Not everyone is so sorted in life to maintain composure, we should not criticise them for not having it all.

If someone's life is career-oriented and their way to identify themselves then who are we to subject our opinion on their way of life. Maybe career is all they have. We should respect that without saying, "well, that is where you went wrong", it shouldn't be like that. 
Life is difficult regardless of career, it is much bigger than that. We should not presume one's decision when there are systems which are much bigger than a single individual. At a time of disciplinary partitioning of the lockdown where there are systems of the biopolitics. Mental health has magnified in the private sphere as we are disconnected from our social life, many individuals have taken this decision. Also, there cannot be a comparison with our way of life, we do not live in an environment where the stakes are so high. You may disagree with me but I think we don't stand the right to critique that individual decision.
[16/06/20, 10:20:47 PM] Rishika: Basically what I was saying. There's no one size fits all unfortunately, but taking steps / getting help depends on each individual's needs (for those who can and want to access it of course).

[17/06/20, 2:14:27 PM] Tilok Dadu: Really enjoyed listening to Nandinie ,Arpan and Rishika. Thank you so much. I would like to add a little bit which you can ponder upon.
You have no control over situations and people you interact with,  but you can have control over yourself if you wish to develop your mental strength. In this present environment of power play worldwide you have to learn to survive gracefully and then look  for strategies positioning.
In short ,be tough headed ,plan your career, evaluate risk and be flexible. Wishing you all the best for a successful career.

[22/06/20, 8:23:32 PM] Moon Pishi: _THE  MALABAR  HILL MURDER CASE_

At the twilight hour on 12th January, 1925,  there was regular traffic on Malabar Hill 
and Abdul Kadir Bawla alongwith his manager named Mathew and a woman passenger were driving from Kemp's Corner to Hanging Gardens.

Suddenly, as their car turned on Little Gibbs road, there was a collision as a red car bumped into them. 
Then, 6-7 people armed with pistols, knives and khukris got out, surrounded them and tried to kidnap the woman.

When Bawla tried to protect the woman, he was shot with a pistol and the woman who had severe knife injuries on her face was screaming for help.

Suddenly, another car drove up and 3 officers of the British army - Lt. Saegert, Lt. Batley and Lt. Stephen stepped out to help the woman.

They had been returning back to Colaba after a game of golf at Willingdon Club and they attacked the kidnappers with their golf clubs. Saegert was hit by bullets but he managed to rescue the woman and carry her to safety.

The others managed to overpower the kidnappers and handed them over to the police. 

Unfortunately, Bawla could not be saved and succumbed to injuries but the woman who was the target of the attempted kidnapping survived to give testimony in court...
And it was a royal scandal !!

Her name was Mumtaz Begum and she had been a Muslim danseuse in the harem of Maharaja Tukojirao Holkar III of Indore.

After 10 years of slavery, the 25 year old Mumtaz had managed to escape and reached Mumbai via Amritsar, Delhi and Nagpur.

She sought refuge with her unofficial husband Abdul Kadir Bawla and started living with him.

Apparently, the Maharaja saw his mistress' escapade as an affront to his royal dignity and a conspiracy was hatched to bring her back to Indore and avenge the insult.

In the Mumbai High Court, 9 people were charged in the Malabar Hill Murder Case of which 2 got acquitted, 3 were given life sentence and 3 others were given the death sentence (of which 1 turned mad and escaped gallows). 
The 9th accused was found guilty only of conspiracy and his case dragged along but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.

The name of Holkars was tarnished and even the Maharaja had to face consequences.

Tukojirao III was forced to abdicate in favour of his son..... and that is how Yashwantrao Holkar II, the father of Richard Holkar became the Maharaja of Indore in his teens !!!

(After abdication, Tukojirao III stayed mostly in Paris and married an American Nancy Miller (Sharmishtha Devi Holkar) as his third wife and had 4 daughters. One of the daughters was later married to the royal family of Kagal near Kolhapur and her son became a character artiste in Bollywood - Vijayendra Ghatge.)  

Incidentally, in the Malabar Hill Murder Case, the defence attorney for the Adjutant General of the Holkar forces was a famous Mumbai based lawyer whose residence at Malbar Hill was in close proximity to the site of the murder. 
He unsuccessfully argued for a lesser sentence for accused No 9 - Sardar Anandrao Phanse (who had been convicted of conspiracy) and managed to get the judge's sympathy but no leniency. Nevertheless, the lawyer tried his best and managed to make an appeal to the privy council, where it got dismissed.

Today, doubt whether the Holkars (or indeed anybody else), would care to see the irony that the lawyer who defended the honour of a Hindu royalty accused of exploiting a Muslim lady would later become the father of an Islamic nation...

৮ বছরের একটা বাচ্চা ছেলে ১ টাকার একটা কয়েন হাতে নিয়ে দোকানে গিয়ে বললো,
--আপনার দোকানে কি ভগবানকে পাওয়া যাবে?

দোকানদার একথা শুনে কয়েনটি ছুড়ে ফেলে দিয়ে তাড়িয়ে দিলো ছেলেটিকে।

ছেলেটি পাশের দোকানে গিয়ে ১ টাকা দিয়ে চুপচাপ দাঁড়িয়ে রইলো!

-- এই ছেলে.. ১ টাকা দিয়ে কি চাও তুমি?
-- আমি ভগবানকে চাই। আপনার দোকানে আছে?

দ্বিতীয় দোকানদারও তাড়িয়ে দিলো।

কিন্তু, অবুঝ ছেলেটি হাল ছাড়লো না। একটার পর একটা দোকানে ঘুরতে লাগলো। ঘুরতে ঘুরতে চল্লিশটা দোকান ঘোরার পর এক বয়স্ক দোকানদার জিজ্ঞাসা করলো,

-- তুমি ভগবানকে কিনতে চাও কেন? কি করবে ভগবানকে দিয়ে?

এই প্রথম কোন দোকানদারের মুখে এরকম প্রশ্ন শুনে ছেলেটির চোখেমুখে আশার আলো ফুটে উঠলো৷ নিশ্চয়ই এই দোকানে ভগবানকে পাওয়া যাবে! হতচকিত কণ্ঠে উত্তর দিলো,

*আমার তো বাবা নাই, এই দুনিয়াতে আমার মা ছাড়া আর কেউ নাই। আমার মা সারাদিন কাজ করে আমার জন্য খাবার নিয়ে আসে। আমার মা এখন হাসপাতালে। মা মরে গেলে আমি খাবো কি? ডাক্তার বলেছে, একমাত্র ভগবানই পারে আমার মাকে বাঁচাতে। আপনার দোকানে কি ভগবানকে পাওয়া যাবে*?

--হ্যাঁ পাওয়া যাবে...! কত টাকা আছে তোমার কাছে?

--মাত্র এক টাকা।

--সমস্যা নেই। এক টাকাতেই ভগবানকে পাওয়া যাবে।

দোকানদার বাচ্চাটির কাছ থেকে এক টাকা নিয়ে খুঁজে দেখলো এক টাকায় এক গ্লাস জল ছাড়া বিক্রি করার মতো কিছুই নেই। *তাই ছেলেটিকে ফিল্টার থেকে এক গ্লাস জল ধরিয়ে দিয়ে বললো, এই জলটা খাওয়ালেই তোমার মা সুস্থ হয়ে যাবে*।

পরের দিন একদল মেডিকেল স্পেশালিষ্ট ঢুকলো সেই হাসপাতালে। ছেলেটির মায়ের অপারেশন হলো। খুব দ্রুতই তিনি সুস্থ হয়ে উঠলেন।

ডিসচার্জ এর কাগজে হাসপাতালের বিল দেখে মহিলার অজ্ঞান হবার মতো অবস্থা। ডাক্তার উনাকে আশ্বস্ত করে বললো, "টেনশনের কিছু নেই। একজন বয়স্ক ভদ্রলোক আপনার সব বিল পরিশোধ করে দিয়েছেন। সাথে একটা চিঠি দিয়েছেন"। 

মহিলাটি চিঠি খুলে পড়ে দেখলো তাতে লেখা-
*"আমাকে ধন্যবাদ দেওয়ার কোন প্রয়োজন নেই। আপনাকে তো বাঁচিয়েছেন স্বয়ং ভগবান ... আমি তো শুধু উসিলা মাত্র। বরং ধন্যবাদ দিলে দিন আপনার অবুঝ বাচ্চাটিকে। যে একটাকা হাতে নিয়ে অবুঝের মতো ভগবানকে খুঁজে বেড়িয়েছে। তার বুকভরা বিশ্বাস ছিলো, একমাত্র ভগবানই পারে আপনাকে বাঁচাতে। এর নামই বিশ্বাস... এর নামই ভক্তি । ভগবানকে খুঁজে পেতে কোটি টাকা দান দক্ষিণা করতে হয়না, বিশ্বাস নিয়ে মন থেকে খুঁজলে এক টাকাতেও পাওয়া যায়।"*



*আসুন না, সবাই এই করোণার মহামারি থেকে বাঁচতে মন থেকে ভগবানকে* *খুঁজি...তাঁর কাছে প্রার্থনা করি... তাঁর কাছে ক্ষমা চাই*..!!!
*নিশ্চয়ই ভগবানই আমাদের এই বিপদ থেকে রক্ষা করতে পারেন*।

 7. All meals should be warm (not cold).
 And that's all we do in the hospital to strengthen the immune system

 Note that the pH of coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5

 Therefore, all we have to do to eliminate the virus is to consume more alkaline foods above the acidity level of the virus.
 Such as :
 Bananas 
 Green lemon - 9.9 pH
 Yellow Lemon - 8.2 pH
 Avocado - 15.6 pH
 * Garlic - 13.2 pH
 * Mango - 8.7 pH
 * Tangerine - 8.5 pH
 * Pineapple - 12.7 pH
 * Watercress - 22.7 pH
 * Oranges - 9.2 pH

 How to know that you are infected with corona virus?

 1. Itchy throat
 2. Dry throat
 3. Dry cough
 4. High temperature
 5. Shortness of breath
 6. Loss of smell ....
 And lemon with warm water eliminates the virus at the beginning before reaching the lungs ...

We board this train when we are born and our parents are the ones who get our ticket. 

We believe they will always travel on this train with us.

However, at some station our parents will get off the train, leaving us alone on this journey.  

As time goes by, other passengers will board the train,  many of whom will be significant - our siblings, friends, children, and even the love of our life. 

Many will get off during the journey and leave a permanent vacuum in our lives.

Many will go so unnoticed that we won't even know when they vacated their seats and got off the train ! 

This train ride will be full of joy, sorrow, fantasy, expectations, hellos, good-byes, and farewells.

A good journey is helping, loving, having a good relationship with all co passengers...
and making sure that we give our best to make their journey comfortable.  

The mystery of this fabulous journey is ;
We do not know at which station we ourselves are going to get off.

So, we must live in the best way - adjust, forget, forgive, and offer the best of what we have. 

It is important to do this because when the time comes for us to leave our seat... we should leave behind beautiful memories for those who will continue to travel on the train of life.....

[25/08/20, 2:32:02 PM] ‪+91 98105 89450‬: When they asked her to reveal her beauty secrets, Audrey Hepburn wrote this beautiful text that was later read at her funeral.

′′ To have attractive lips, speak kind words.
To have a loving look, look for the good side of people.
To look skinny, share your food with the hungry.
To have beautiful hair, let a child cross it with his own fingers once a day.
To have a beautiful poise, walk knowing you're never alone, because those who love and loved you accompany you.
People, even more than objects, need to be fixed, spoiled, awakened, wanted and saved: never give up on anyone.
Remember, if you ever need a hand, you'll find them at the end of both your arms. When you become old, you will discover that you have two hands, one to help yourself, the second to help others.
The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, in her face or in her way of fixing her hair. The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes, because that is the door open to her heart, the source of her love.
The beauty of  woman doesn't lie in her makeup but the true beauty of a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the tenderness that gives love the passion that it expresses. The beauty of a woman grows over the years!

 Walter Kaufman was a Jew and took refuge in India to escape persecution of Jews in Germany. He was a conductor (music) , composer and became the director of AIR in Bombay. This signature tune of AIR was composed by him based on raga Shivranjani and the flute was played by the father of famous composer/conductor Zubin Mehta.

বড় কষ্টে আছি!
দুর্গাপুজো নিয়ে বাঙালিদের একটা আলাদা সেন্টিমেন্ট আছে, মানি। তবু প্রশ্ন জাগে, পরম সঙ্কটকালেও কি উৎসব পালন এতটাই জরুরি? যুুদ্ধ লাগলে কি দেশে পুজো হয়?  কেউ মারা গেলে সে বাড়িতে তো সেবছর শাস্ত্রমতে  পুজো বন্ধ থাকে জানি। অথচ আমাদের এত মানুষ মারা গেলেন, এখনও যাচ্ছেন, তবু প্রতিবারের মত পুজোয় ঠাকুর দেখা চাই? ডাক্তারদের জন্য থালা বাজাব শুধু, তাদের মৃত্যুকে সম্মান দেখাতে  নিজেদের আনন্দে কণামাত্র ছাড় দেব না?  এ কেমন সমাজে বাস করছি আমরা?  জর্জ ফ্লয়েডের জন্য সহানুভূতিতে মুখর হয়েছি আমরা, কিন্তু আমাদের শত শত চিকিৎসাকর্মী, সমাজসেবী এবং সাধারণমানুষের জীবনদানের সমর্থনে কোনো সহানুভূতির বাণী নেই? নাকি আমরা শুধু বাণীতেই প্রতিবাদ জানাই, কাজে করতে চাই না? 
আচ্ছা, পারি না সবাই একজোট হয়ে বলতে, চাই না এবছর মন্ডপের পুজো , হোক ভার্চুয়াল পুজো?  ভার্চুয়াল শ্রাদ্ধক্রিয়া করতে শিখলাম, প্রিয়জনকে চোখের দেখাটুকু পর্যন্ত না দেখে  শেষবিদায় জানানোর হৃদয়বিদারক ঘটনা , তাও মেনে নিলাম আর পুজোর আনন্দ ছাড়তে পারব না? আপনাদের কারো এমনটা মনে হয় না? কজন বলতে রাজি, এবছর পুজো বাইরে গিয়ে নয়, ঘরে বসে! এবছর আনন্দযাপন নয়, শোকযাপন। এবছর আমরা ব্যতিক্রমী হব। এবছর আমরা মানুষের ধর্ম পালন করব!
এইটুকু করলে অন্যের প্রাণদানের মূল্য যদি নাও দিতে চাই, নিজেদের এতদিন ইঁদুরের মত ঘরে বসে কাটানোরও একটা মানে হবে, একটা ভবিষ্যৎ থাকবে। নইলে সব বৃথা হয়ে যাবে! 
লাইক চাই না, দেখি কজন সহমত হয়ে নিজেদের ওয়ালে এটা পোস্ট করেন।  কজন বাস্তবে এমনটা মেনে নিতে প্রস্তুত। দেখি কজন বাঙালি এখনও মানুষ হয়ে বেঁচে আছেন !.....🤝🏼🤞🏼🙏🏼

[03/10/20, 4:15:17 PM] Laila Jethima: A story recalled by Leena Chandavarkar:

Once Kishore Kumar asked Lata Mangeshkar,  his which song she liked the best.

Lata smiled and asked him, "Dada, bol doon ya gaa kar sunao".

to which Kishore said "Gaa kar hi sunaiye".

Lata laughed and said OK, but not today.

Few months later it was Lataji's birthday and Kishore Kumar received a gift box from Lataji.
 
Kishore used to always wish Lataji on her birthday with gifts.
It had a note on it from Lataji, it said " Dada, aapne itni baar mere janamdin par tohfe bheje hain, ese return gift samaj lena, aur zaroore batana aap ko agar aacha laga"

He opened the box and there was a tape inside. It was the song Lataji loved most from all of Kishore's song, 

sung by Lata herself. 

She had contacted HMV recording studio, and gone there recorded it only for Kishore kumar.

It seems Kishore listened to this song many time when he sat alone in his room.

Nobody has heard this Kishore song sung by Lata exclusively for Kishore Kumar.

Just listen to this, released by his wife Leena for the first time ever.

Never heard before, enjoy

[07/10/20, 10:47:45 AM] Moon Pishi: *Important Message for all* 

The hot water you drink is good for your throat. But this corona virus is hidden behind the paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. The hot water we drink does not reach there. After 4 to 5 days this virus that was hidden behind the paranasal sinus reaches your lungs. Then you have trouble breathing.

That's why it is very important to take steam, which reaches the back of your paranasal sinus. You have to kill this virus in the nose with steam.

At 50°C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. At 60°C this virus becomes so weak that any human immunity system can fight against it. At 70°C this virus dies completely.

This is what steam does. The entire public health department knows this. But everyone wants to take advantage of this pandemic. So they don't share this information openly.

One who stays at home should take steam once a day. If you go to the market to buy vegetables, take it twice a day. Anyone who meets some people or goes to office should take steam 3 times a day.

*Steam week* 
According to doctors, Covid -19 can be killed by inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, eliminating the Coronavirus.  If all the people started a steam drive campaign for a week, the pandemic will soon end. So here is a suggestion: 

* Start the process for a week from 5th October to 11th October or from whenever, morning and evening, for just 5 minutes each time, to inhale steam.  If all adopt this practice for a week  the deadly Covid-19 will be erased. This practice has no side effects either.*

So please send this message to all your relatives, friends and neighbours, so that we all can kill this corona virus together and live and walk freely in this beautiful world.

*Thank you*

You are welcome to send this to your known groups / friends as a precautionary measure. 🙏🏼

ভক্তি ও শাস্ত্রবিধির বিরোধে শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণদেব মথুরকে যা বলেছিলেন, বিসর্জনের তাৎপর্যার্থে তা স্মরণীয়। মথুর শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণদেবকে যখন জানালেন- তিনি প্রাণ থাকতে দেবী দুর্গা মাকে বিসর্জন দিতে পারবেন না, তখন শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণদেব হেসে তাঁকে বলেন: "ওঃ! এই তোমার ভয়? তা মাকে ছেড়ে তোমায় থাকতে হবে কে বললে? আর বিসর্জন দিলেই বা তিনি যাবেন কোথায়? ছেলেকে ছেড়ে মা কি কখন থাকতে পারে? এ তিন দিন বাইরে দালানে বসে তোমার পূজা নিয়েছেন, আজ থেকে তোমার আরও নিকটে থেকে- সর্বদা তোমার হৃদয়ে বসে তোমার পূজা নেবেন। মাকে বিসর্জন দেবে কোথায়? বিসর্জন দেবে নিজের হৃদয়ে।"

শুভ বিজয়া।

বড়দের প্রণাম, ছোটদের ভালোবাসা ও আদর, আর সমবয়স্কদের শুভেচ্ছা ও অভিনন্দন জানাই।

সবার জীবন শান্তি, সৌভাগ্য, আরোগ্য, আনন্দ ও সাফল্যে ভরে উঠুক।

Around 1 we reached and by 1:30 amra ashti viserjan korlam ekdum majh ganga. It was beautiful and really pretty, while we were on the boat to get to the center we were singing her favourite songs.  Hopefully now her soul will find some relief in ganga after burning so much.

[03/11/20, 3:36:40 PM] Nandinie Cousin: Didima sang this song to express her condolences to her Dada. She said this song is very special and meaningful. She wanted to do gaan and bajna  as it was dear to her and to her dada. It was her way of saving the RK DuttaGupta family from the loss of the eldest patriarch. 

As the elders are leaving for someplace nice it is on us to keep the family bondings together.

[03/11/20, 3:51:39 PM] Jhumna Pishi: So beautifully put, Nandini. I agree wholeheartedly with you. Jethu, Pishimoni and that generation knew/know just how to effortlessly make everyone feel so loved and keep the family together. It’s a tall benchmark. Loved the song that you shared ....felt like she was right here by my side. Lots of love...
[03/11/20, 3:52:06 PM] Jhumna Pishi: Please do share more pics... they are priceless!
[03/11/20, 3:54:58 PM] ‪+91 98300 36836‬: Yes Nandinie.rarely have i seen such close bonding between brothers and sisters.it is very special 
Now the next generation looks up to Parthoda and Laila to hold the family together
[03/11/20, 3:57:17 PM] Chordi Pune: Puchu, agree wholeheartedly! So glad you have this thought, my dear!
Isn’t it amazing how well she sang even at her age! 
Love and hugs to you❤️

[03/11/20, 4:11:45 PM] Nandinie Cousin: Yes, she did, so wonderfully. Whenever I hear this song, all I can think is Khela Ghor wasn't enough for her.
[03/11/20, 4:15:16 PM] ‪+44 7500 455661‬: Nandinie, you’ve put it so beautifully..we almost always took their presence for granted and now the void feels overwhelming. Love the song you shared. There’s another song that I find myself humming very often - jhir jhir borosha- that I learnt from Pishimoni. It will always remind me of her..❤️
[03/11/20, 4:36:40 PM] Laila Jethima: So beautifully sung , brought back memories of her singing on stage during Durga pujo and then coming running to greet us and take approval from her dada

[25/11/20, 10:35:23 AM] Chordi Pune: So beautiful. Cannot resist not to share. 


TRUE STORY...PLEASE DO NOT DELETE, RETURN IF YOU CAN'T FORWARD TO AT LEAST ONE PERSON!!!
 
At the prodding of my friends I am writing this story.  My name is Mildred Honor. I am a former elementary school Music Teacher from Des Moines, Iowa.

I have always supplemented my income by Teaching Piano Lessons...Something I have done for over 30 years. During those years, I found that Children have many levels of musical ability, and even though I have never had the prodigy, I have taught some very talented students. However, I have also had my share of what I call 'Musically Challenged Pupils.

One such Pupil being Robby. Robby was 11 years old when his Mother (a Single Mom) dropped him off for his first Piano Lesson.

I prefer that Students (especially Boys) begin at  an earlier age, which I explained to Robby.  But Robby said that it had always been his Mother's Dream to hear him play the Piano, so I took him as a Student.

At the end of each weekly Lesson he would always say 'My Mom's going to hear me Play someday.'  But to me, it seemed hopeless, he just did not have any Inborn Ability.I only knew his Mother from a distance as she dropped Robby off or waited in her aged Car to pick him up.  She always waved and smiled, but never dropped in;

Then one day Robby stopped coming for his Lessons.  I thought about calling him, but Assumed that because of his lack of Ability he had decided to pursue something else. I was also glad that he had stopped coming. He was a Bad Advertisement for my Teaching!

Several Weeks later I mailed a flyer recital to the Students' homes. To my surprise, Robby (who had received a flyer) asked if he could be in the Recital. I told him that the Recital was for current Pupils and that because he had dropped out, he really did not Qualify.

He told me that his Mother had been Sick and Unable to take him to his piano lessons, but that he had been practicing.  'Please Miss Honor, I've just got to Play,' he insisted. I don't know what led me to allow him to play in the Recital - perhaps it was his insistence or maybe something inside of me saying that it would be all right;

The night of the Recital came and the high school gymnasium was packed with Parents, Relatives and Friends. I put Robby last in the Program, just before I was to come up and thank all the Students and Play a finishing piece. I thought that any damage he might do would come at the end of the Program and I could always salvage his poor performance through my 'Curtain Closer'.

Well, the Recital went off without a Hitch, the Students had been Practicing and it Showed. Then Robby came up on the stage. His Clothes were Wrinkled and his Hair looked as though he had run an egg beater through it. 'Why wasn't he dressed up like the other Students?' I thought. 'Why didn't his Mother at least make him Comb his Hair for this Special Night?'

Robby pulled out the Piano bench, and I was Surprised when he announced that he had chosen to play Mozart's Concerto No.21 in C Major.  I was not prepared for what I heard next.  His fingers were light on the keys, they even danced nimbly on the Ivories.  He went from Pianissimo to Fortissimo, from Allegro to Virtuoso; his Suspended Chords that Mozart demands were Magnificent!  Never had I heard Mozart played so well by anyone his age.

After six and a half minutes, he ended in a Grand Crescendo, and everyone was on their feet in Wild Applause!!! Overcome and in Tears, I ran up on stage and put my arms around Robby in Joy; 

'I have never heard you Play like that Robby, how did you do it?'  Through the Microphone Robby explained: 'Well, Miss Honor, Remember I told you that my Mom was sick?  Well, she actually had Cancer and Passed Away this Morning. And well... she was  Born Deaf, so tonight was the first time she had ever heard me Play, and I wanted to make it Special.,
 
There wasn't a Dry Eye in the house that evening.  As People from Social Services led Robby from the stage to be placed in to Foster Care, I noticed that even their Eyes were red and Puffy.  I thought to myself then how much Richer my Life had been for taking Robby as my Pupil.

No, I have never had a Prodigy, but that night I became a Prodigy... of Robby. He was the Teacher and I was the Pupil, for he had taught me the meaning of Perseverance and Love and Believing in Yourself, and may be even taking a chance on someone and you didn't know why.

Robby was Killed years later in the Senseless Bombing of the Alfred P. Murray Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April, 1995.

[01/12/20, 8:48:34 AM] Chordi Pune: Thanks, Moon!👍
[01/12/20, 8:49:01 AM] Chordi Pune: I didn’t write this - but WOW does it speak to my heart!!!  Worth the read.
Barely the day started and... it's already six in the evening.
Barely arrived on Monday and it's already Friday.
... and the month is already over.
... and the year is almost over.
... and already 40, 50 or 60 years of our lives have passed.
... and we realize that we lost our parents, friends.
and we realize it's too late to go back...
So... Let's try, despite everything, to enjoy the remaining time...
Let's keep looking for activities that we like...
Let's put some color in our grey...
Let's smile at the little things in life that put balm in our hearts.
And despite everything, we must continue to enjoy with serenity this time we have left. Let's try to eliminate the afters...
I'm doing it after...
I'll say after...
I'll think about it after...
We leave everything for later like ′′ after ′′ is ours.
Because what we don't understand is that:
Afterwards, the coffee gets cold...
afterwards, priorities change...
Afterwards, the charm is broken...
afterwards, health passes...
Afterwards, the kids grow up...
Afterwards parents get old...
Afterwards, promises are forgotten...
afterwards, the day becomes the night...
afterwards life ends...
And then it's often too late....
So... Let's leave nothing for later...
Because still waiting see you later, we can lose the best moments,
the best experiences,
best friends,
the best family...
The day is today... The moment is now...
We are no longer at the age where we can afford to postpone what needs to be done right away.

Good morning 🌄

[21/12/20, 2:22:35 PM] Partho Jethu: My view is that we do a separate group including them . Doing a larger group is a good idea. Some discussions on this group will probably be more relevant and inclusive to this group. Therefore propose 2 groups. We can use our judgement to decide which message we put on which group.
[21/12/20, 2:22:37 PM] ‪+91 98300 36836‬: We are all one family after all

[25/12/20, 4:38:30 PM] Mama: I have a suggestion. I don’t know how to do but if someone can help me. This time let’s make a collage of Mamamoni Monimashi and ma. Let them be together. So that we don’t need to change the group icon so often.
[25/12/20, 4:40:37 PM] Mama: I think it’s unbearable to see our near and dear ones exiting this group so fast

[25/12/20, 4:42:56 PM] ‪+91 98302 67133‬: Please...don't talk about it
[25/12/20, 5:32:31 PM] Chordi Pune: Mouli, we’ll look for photographs. Meanwhile if you or anyone else can make a collage, go ahead. Completely understand. It’s painful for everyone.
[25/12/20, 5:52:24 PM] Mama: No Chotomamima please don’t misunderstand. I was a bit emotional. I am unable to forget that helpless look in her eyes, the tears, the restlessness, the hand movement overall the suffering that she was going through when I went to meet her for the first time day before yesterday. We will do the collage afterwards. Now let the icon remain the way it is.

[23/01/21, 3:29:52 PM] Jhumna Pishi: This one’s for my Phulpishi: 

I have always received so much love and pampering from my Jethu and Pishis...all of them! There has always been so much to learn from this group of feisty siblings. Not sure if God makes this type of human beings any more. High wit, high grit. 

And while all my Pishis were lucky to have a daughter... only my Phulpishi suffered the heart wrenching pain of losing hers. But she didn’t seem to lose faith in life or God...or even in goodness or in her music. 

I remember, as I stepped into my teens and as I slipped into a revolting mind that always felt misunderstood by her parents :)) Phulpishi would often write to me to let off some of that steam. Our special little bond had been born long before that when we used to talk to each other through little letters and postcards. She was my only confidante then - strict and yet always there for me. I suffer the guilt of not being there for her as much, even after I had promised her, following papaididi’s untimely unfair passing away. 

While we never pause before drawing judgments (even on ourselves), it’s strange how much time it takes for us to overlook differences and forgive. She taught me that. I’m still struggling to put it to practice. I never heard her complain ...even when I didn’t find time to call her back. She was always grateful for what she had. 

I will always remember her mischief-filled smirks that was often followed by some awkward and hilarious story from her childhood, her soulful strong voice when she sang or called out to us, her observations and anecdotes about life, her teaching me to be unapologetic about my decisions (and, of course, while gorging on homemade luchis!!!), her warning me to be mindful about never being petty. I remember her nudging me lovingly with a “Eyi je, Jhumnii Rani, ebaar ekta baccha koro!”... so many memories! 

I’m selfishly grateful to have crossed paths with her. As a daughter, my “daughterhood” remains incomplete without her presence. She was a very important person to me. And I wish her so much love and life in her next innings. And today, I bid her farewell ...as a daughter too.

I’m sure she is around ...watching us. Of course, it’s a time of grief - Wish we all could fix a date and remember her fondly.
[23/01/21, 3:45:40 PM] Chordi Pune: ❤️
[23/01/21, 3:51:04 PM] Chordi Pune: Unexpected grievous losses one after another... we’re too numbed by the pain to express our sorrow and disbelief. 
Life is so unpredictable!
[23/01/21, 4:05:28 PM] Chordi Pune: Jhumna, when I stayed in the Golpark house as a young bride, continuing with my studies in college, Phulpishi was the substitute for my strict mother making sure I concentrated on my studies and worked hard for good grades. Bubai( then a student of class 7 or 8) and I would practise songs in the evening before settling down with our books. 
I could write pages on the fond and fun memories of that period ...😄🤗

[24/01/21, 11:20:05 AM] Moon Pishi: The trip to Chunar on the tonga and the ganges - bajra trip.
[24/01/21, 11:31:38 AM] Chordi Pune: Benaras has many stories...
[24/01/21, 11:34:44 AM] Papa: Benaras, then it was 1974. 
Also, I have vague thought that that I used to beat the small girl in the pic.
[24/01/21, 11:36:45 AM] Chordi Pune: Poor little girl...up against her naughty brothers🤗
[24/01/21, 11:59:47 AM] Jhumna Pishi: His lombito?? What’s that?!

🙏🙏🙏
[07/05/21, 6:31:10 PM] Papa: If Mamamoni was like the virtual big umbrella, Mamima was like the Mother like figure for the entire RKD family connecting all the dots. I have wonderful memories around the 2BHK 201 Shivsagar, 36/D Pali Hill. Those were thr wonderful carefree bachelorhood days of many of us in the 80s and early 90s. Sleeping 4-5 people in the hall floor when everyone used to come was never an inconvenience. 
Mamima, you are not there now in physical form, but you ARE there as is everyone who left their physical bodies recently. Thank you for the wonderful experiences.

[07/05/21, 9:01:18 PM] Moon Pishi: Shivsagar building was an beautiful experience for all of us. Pali hill, breathtaking location , glamorous outskirts. But the house was so welcoming, so vibrant. I learnt so much from Mani in her quite and gentle way. 
May her soul rest in peace.🙏🙏🙏
May the Lord give Partho, Laila, Ayush and to all of us the strength to bear the deep loss, as well for the others , our near and dear ones who departed recently.🙏🙏🙏
[07/05/21, 9:01:46 PM] Moon Pishi: quiet
[07/05/21, 9:20:44 PM] Papa: This is to the younger lots - we had a great time in our younger days, thanks to the close knit family rules under your great grandmother Sabitri DG and thanks to our Mamas and Mashis. 
We cousins shared a lot of space and time. We were first cousins.
You’ll are second cousins.
And now the space and time has become all virtual.
I am sure that our generation would like to keep the traditions on by providing our space and time for you’ll to remain connected.
Whether you’ll really do that is upto you.
[07/05/21, 10:04:59 PM] Prateek Dasgupta: During my younger days, I remember Didima and Dadu were from the few relatives who would never forget to call me on my birthday.  And I remember this cause every birthday I would be expecting a call from them. :)
[07/05/21, 10:10:25 PM] Chordi Pune: Completely agree with you Bubai and Moon. I think each of us has very very special memories of Pali Hill home as those we have of Golpark house. The warmth and love we experienced there will always remain in our hearts and perhaps be our guiding light! Cannot be expressed in words. 
My deepest respect for all loved ones who departed in the recent months and perhaps united somewhere up there. May they find eternal peace and continue to shower their blessings on us.

Puurnnasya Puurnnam-Aadaaya Puurnnam-Eva-Avashissyate ||
Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||

Meaning:
1: Om, That (Outer World) is Purna (Full with Divine Consciousness); This (Inner World) is also Purna (Full with Divine Consciousness); From Purna is manifested Purna (From the Fullness of Divine Consciousness the World is manifested),
2: Taking Purna from Purna, Purna indeed remains (Because Divine Consciousness is Non-Dual and Infinite),
3: Om, Peace, Peace, Peace.

WhatsApp settings were updated last night without warning.

etc........

You can change the default settings as follows:

1. Go to WhatsApp:
2. Go into Settings
3. Go to Account
4. Go to Privacy
5.  Go to Groups
6.  Change from (Everyone) to (My Contacts)

[12/08/21, 1:02:14 PM] Tilok Dadu: 👌👌👌👌👌
[13/08/21, 4:50:14 PM] Moon Pishi: All of us should know;

On 15th of August, on India's Independence Day, our Natonal Flag, the Tricolour, is "hoisted". Whereas on the 26th January, that is, on our Republic Day, it is "unfurled". 

So, what is the difference between hoisting and unfurling? 

Well, on 15th of August, the flag is kept folded, at the bottom of the flag pole, and is pulled up to the tip of the pole before it is spread out.

This is hoisting of a flag. It signifies the country was freed after a span of colonial domination. 

On the other hand, on 26th January (since 1950) the tricolour is unfurled, that is, the flag stays high up at the tip of the flag pole, (not at the middle or lower height of the pole) folded,  and is spread out with the pull of the rope. 

This is unfurling of the tricolour. It signifies that as a flag of an already free country, it cannot stay hung at a lower height, but is held high above. 

This is a small but very significant aspect of how our tricolour is honoured with the country's history.

[08/10/21, 1:51:25 AM] Partho Jethu: There would be talk the night before that the alarm should be set early. I would be woken up when the radio transmission started ( around 5am or 5.30). We would try n tune into AIR Calcutta. Ma would light the dhoop kathi in the puja area. The combination of Biren Bhadra's voice, Pankaj Mallick's music and the wafting agarbatti smell, filled you, as Moon put it, with some inexplicable excitement and hope , foreboding the advent of good and happy times. Within 15 min i would be asleep but the radio sound seemed to hum in the background of semi consciousness. Strict instructions were given to Kaka and Ma to wake me before the Ya devi sarva bhooteshu... namo namaha section. By the time the song Rupang dehi came on, it would be morning outside. Time to brush your teeth half an hour earlier than normal n sit at the dining table with a science textbook. It was term exam time. Didu n Dadu would be on the Bombay mail via Nagpur. In just over a week's time would come the evening when by some strange design Kaka and I would end up wearing identical shirts. 
Biren Bhadra's Mahalaya is as much part of Bong identity as Tagore, Rosogolla, football, ilish maach, monkey cap, Feluda, Abol Tabol, acidity with unienzyme / Digene,...... 
Thanks Pishi, Kakima, Moon, Mammoni, Mana for triggering these memories.
